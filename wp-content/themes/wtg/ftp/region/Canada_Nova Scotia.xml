The northeast is rural and rocky, while the south and southwest are lush and fertile. The Fundy region's red soil was originally part of the present North African continent.

<p>For the ultimate road trip, cruise the 300km (186-mile) Cabot Trail around Cape Breton Island, where gorgeous beaches and dreamy highlands lure you out of your car. In fact, why not take your time and do the whole thing by bike?</p>
<p>There are no prizes for guessing which nation Nova Scotia takes its name from. If your Latin has failed you, the ubiquity of kilts, energetic Highland dancers and boot-stomping fiddle bands might give it away. Not to mention the province&rsquo;s very own Gaelic college.</p>
