<p>In general, Brazil is a year-round destination with temperatures rarely dip below 20&deg;C (68&deg;F), apart from in the mountains and southern regions. The climate varies from hot and dry in the arid interior to humid and sticky in the tropical rainforests of the Amazon jungle.</p>
<p><strong>Bel&eacute;m</strong> is the capital and largest city of the state of Par&aacute; in the country's north, as well as the gateway to the River Amazon. Bel&eacute;m has a tropical rainforest climate with daily mean stands at a toasty 26&deg;C (79&deg;F) throughout the year. The city also receives a fair amount of rain (60mm on the average) all year round.</p>
<p><strong>S&atilde;o Paulo</strong>, situated in South-eastern Brazil, is the country's the most populous city. S&atilde;o Paulo has a humid subtropical climate with indistinct four seasons. January is the hottest and also the wettest month, with an average temperature of 25&deg;C (76&deg;F) and 170mm of rainfall. On the contrary, June is the coldest month although temperatures still averaging at a comfortable 19&deg;C (66&deg;F).</p>
<p><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong> is about 440km (273 miles) east of S&atilde;o Paulo but has a different climate classification. Rio's summer (December to February) can be very hot with temperatures reaching 40&deg;C (104&deg;F), plus the city also receives abundant rainfall. The hot and wet weather doesn&rsquo;t stop millions of tourists coming to Rio de Janeiro in January or February for the annual Carnival though. Rio's winter (July and August) is still fairly warm with temperatures averaging 21&deg;C (70&deg;F), making it an ideal time to visit. For more information, see this <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/rio-de-janeiro/weather">weather in Rio de Janeiro guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Curitiba</strong> is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Paran&aacute;. Located 478km (297 miles) south of S&atilde;o Paulo, Curitiba is in the south region and has a subtropical highland climate with cold fronts bringing rains in summer (December to February) and cold winds in winter (June to August). February is the hottest month, averaging 22&deg;C (72&deg;F) while the average temperature drops to around 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) in June. Also note that parts of the south region, particularly the plateau region, it can get near 0&deg;C (32&deg;F) in winter.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Requiredclothing" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Required Clothing]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>As the weather is generally on the warmer side, bring clothes made from lightweight natural fabrics such as cottons and linens which you can layer up. Waterproofs are a must if visiting during the rainy season, or places like Bel&eacute;m where it receives a substantial amount of rain year around. Bring warm clothing if visiting the south during winter (June to August). On the other hand, the extremely humid climate of the Amazon region demands quick-dry shirts and long cotton pants for any treks or activity tourism. Sunlight around the tropics is extremely strong, so take a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sunglasses. Long-sleeve cotton shirts are also useful in the jungle; they protect you from mosquito bites and the sun.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="TravelInternal"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Getting Around]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="GettingAroundByAir" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Getting Around By Air]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Brazil has one of the largest internal air networks in the world, and there are air services between all Brazilian cities. With such great distances between many of the most popular destinations, flying can be a worthwhile option, saving considerable time and money. Internal flights in Brazil are possible with the shuttle service between S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, a regular service from S&atilde;o Paulo to Bras&iacute;lia and a shuttle service from Bras&iacute;lia to Belo Horizonte.</p>
<p>At weekends and main holiday times (ie Christmas and Carnival) it is advisable to book seats as the services are well used. Panrotas (<a href="http://www.panrotas.com.br" target="_blank">www.panrotas.com.br</a>) gives all timetables and fares for internal air travel. Gol (<a href="http://www.voegol.com.br" target="_blank">www.voegol.com.br</a>) and LATAM (<a href="http://www.latam.com" target="_blank">www.latam.com</a>) operate the largest number of domestic routes. Airport transfers are available between all major centres.</p><p>Always re-confirm flights (at least once); delays and over-bookings do happen. If you change any flights on your airpass be sure to cancel the original booking otherwise the airline may consider it a &lsquo;no-show&rsquo; and cancel all your other flights.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="GettingAroundByWater" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Getting Around by Water]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Ferries serve most coastal ports. One company, Barcas (tel: 0800 721 1012, in Brazil only; <a href="http://www.barcas-sa.com.br/" target="_blank">www.barcas-sa.com.br</a>), operates ferries between Rio de Janeiro and Niter&oacute;i, and between Angra dos Reis and Ilha Grande. The daily commuter ferry to and from Niter&oacute;i is very popular, offering amazing views of Guanabara Bay, and much quicker than the long and often traffic-clogged road route.</p>
<p>River transport is the most efficient method of travel in the Amazon Delta. The main hub is Manaus, with ferries going eastwards along the Rio Amazonas, to Bel&eacute;m and Santar&eacute;m, or upriver from Manaus on the Rio Solim&otilde;es towards the Colombian border at Tabatinga. Many different companies offer regular departures from Manaus, operating out of the main port, Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Hidrovi&aacute;ria (<a href="http://www.portodemanaus.com.br/" target="_blank">www.portodemanaus.com.br</a>), near to the Mercado Municipal.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="GettingAroundByRail" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Getting Around by Rail]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Passenger rail connections in Brazil are virtually non-existent, apart from a few inner-city commuter lines in S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Drivers should also look out for road humps, which can damage the underside of vehicles if taken too fast. Wandering domestic animals, particularly in rural areas, are another hazard.</p>
<p>Traffic jams within cities are common, particularly during rush hours and before long weekends.</p><p>Long-distance coach travel is a great way to get around Brazil, with an excellent network of inter-city routes offered by hundreds of different companies. Fares are economical and coaches are safe and comfortable, with all the usual modern facilities.</p>
<p>Luxury overnight services (<em>leitos</em>) connect the major cities and popular destinations such as Foz do Igua&ccedil;u. There are no nationwide companies, but all cities have a central bus station (<em>rodoviaria</em>), where you can book your journey in advance with a choice of operators.</p><p>All major cities have plenty of taxis, particularly recommended late at night. Official taxis, such as the distinctive yellow-and-blue Rio taxis, are the most reliable. Mini-cabs, with pre-paid tickets, are also available at international airports.</p>
<p>Taxis are metered and passengers should insist that the meter is turned on: the day-time rate is shown by a little flag marked 1 on top of the meter. The higher rate (after 2000, on Sundays and bank holidays) is shown by a flag marked 2. Outside of cities and main tourist sites, taxis may not have meters, in which case agree on the fare in advance. Tipping taxi drivers is not normal practice.</p><p>An International Driving Permit is usually required, although foreign licences are also accepted by most major car hire companies.</p><p>The minimum driving age is 18. The speed limit is 120kph (74mph) on most national highways and 30-90kph (19-55mph) in urban areas. Passing on the right is forbidden. Seat belts must be worn by drivers and passengers. Drivers may use only &lsquo;hands-free&rsquo; phone operation while at the wheel.</p><p>In the event of a breakdown contact your car hire provider. For emergencies call 193.</p><p>International companies operate from major airports and main city centres; the most common are Avis and Hertz. Localiza (tel: 0800 979 2000, in Brazil only; <a href="http://www.localiza.com.br" target="_blank">www.localiza.com.br</a>) is one of the main Brazilian companies. Drivers are generally required to be at least 21 years old.</p><p>Brazil is not a bicycle-friendly country on the whole; only a few cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba, have dedicated bicycle lanes. Rio has a bikeshare system, Mobilicidade (<a href="http://www.mobilicidade.com.br" target="_blank">www.mobilicidade.com.br</a>). S&atilde;o Paulo's scheme is called Bike Sampa (<a href="http://www.mobilicidade.com.br/bikesampa.asp" target="_blank">www.mobilicidade.com.br/bikesampa.asp</a>).</p>
<p>In view of the vast distances, heavy traffic and aggressive driving practices, cycling around the country is not recommended for most visitors.</p><p>The minimum driving age is 18. The speed limit is 120kph (74mph) on most national highways and 30-90kph (19-55mph) in urban areas. Passing on the right is forbidden. Seat belts must be worn by drivers and passengers.

Buses in major cities, including Rio, are massively overcrowded in rush hour however, and crime is a common problem, particularly at night.</p>
<p>S&atilde;o Paulo has a modern metro subway system, and Rio has a three-line metro. Though both systems are relatively small, the trains are clean, safe, economical and reliable. Fares are generally regulated, with interchange links between key bus and metro/rail lines, for instance on the MetroBus feeder bus linking the Rio metro with Copacabana.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="JourneyTimes" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Journey Times]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><table class="DataTable"><tr><td CLASS="DataHead">From</td><td CLASS="DataHead">To</td><TD CLASS="DataHead">Air</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">Road</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">Rail</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Brazil</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">salvador</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">3.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">28.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Brazil</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">satildeo_paulo</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">1.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">7.30</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Brazil</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">florianopolis</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">2.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">18.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Brazil</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">brasiacutelia</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">1.40</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">17.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr></table></DataInfo></OutputData></Section>

Olinda is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a well-preserved colonial quarter crammed with baroque architecture. It's also a popular haven for artists and musicians, with a large gay community.</p>]]><p><b>See a football match at the Maracanã</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Watch the <em>belojogo</em> (beautiful game) in Rio's world-famous Maracanã Stadium. With fans dancing, singing and pounding drums amid clouds of coloured smoke, the carnival atmosphere on the terraces sometimes overshadows the game itself.

The highest fall, the Garganta do Diabo (Devil's Throat) reaches 70m (230ft), which is one and a half times the height of Niagara Falls.</p>]]><p><b>Wildlife watch in the Pantanal</b></p><![CDATA[<p>This spectacularly rich ecosystem in west-central Brazil is home to big cats, reptiles and hundreds of exotic birds. The Pantanal's vast wetlands have wide-open savannah, which, unlike the Amazon's dense rainforests, allow easy viewing of their abundant wildlife. The dry season (April-October) is the best time to visit, when animals cluster around the waterholes and the birds are breeding.</p>]]><p><b>Wonder at Brazil’s stunning capital, Brasília</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Often overlooked by visitors, Brasília is an architectural showpiece, of curvaceous modern buildings dominating the Planalto's flat horizons. The city was designed by world-renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer and many of his creations, including the Cathedral and National Congress, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

After more than a decade of impressive growth, the economy slowed in 2013 and the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014. The IMF predicts a return to positive growth in 2017, with Brazil expected to overtake the UK's economy by 2030. Agriculture is the second largest sector in terms of employment and Brazil is the world's second-largest exporter of agricultural products, principally soya beans, coffee and sugar. There is also a substantial industrial sector, led by the automotive, aircraft, petrochemical, mining, construction and textile production industries. The country possesses large mineral reserves including iron ore - of which Brazil is the world's largest exporter. The development of Brazil's potentially vast oil and gas resources has ended its dependence on energy imports, despite opposition on environmental grounds. The service sector is also important to the economy, particularly in banking and tourism.</p><p>The left-wing Workers Party (PT) government, which took office in 2003, enjoy widespread support, having introduced a raft of progressive social policies and presided over the fastest growing economy in the world between 2003 and 2012.</p><p>Despite the country's considerable natural wealth, it is domestic consumer demand that has made the Real, and the Brazilian economy, continue to boom. As a result, foreign visitors to Brazil will find prices similar to those in Western Europe, particularly in cities such as Rio.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Dress code is generally smart for men and women, and suits are worn when meeting heads of companies or attending semi-formal social functions in exclusive clubs and restaurants. Exchange of business cards is customary at formal meetings, and often by way of introduction. Business people usually expect to deal with someone of an equal status.</p><p>Introductions from mutual contacts are highly valued in Rio de Janeiro, a city where who you know often matters as much as you what you know. Things are generally more relaxed in the extreme heat of the Amazon and northeast of the country, where more practical, casual clothes are the norm.</p><p>Normal business hours are Monday to Friday 0900-1800. Quite often, however, business is done over dinner in a restaurant. Brazilians have an incredibly relaxed attitude to time and are often very late for meetings.</p><p>Brazilians are more casual than their Latin American counterparts but it is important to dress neatly and offer respect. Bear in mind that it can get cold in the south in the winter, though in Rio, temperatures remain higher than in most parts of Europe at the same time, all year round.</p><p>At the beginning of a conversation, strangers should always be addressed with the formal <em>o senhor</em> or <em>a senhora</em> until they use the informal <em>tu</em> or <em>você</em>. Professionals will often be addressed as <em>o doutor</em> or <em>a doutora</em> (doctor), whatever their line of business, as a term of respect. Shaking hands is the first point of contact, although kissing on the cheek is common on subsequent meetings, from men and women to other women. It is very important to take time for pleasantries, which are exchanged, often at some length, at the start and end of a conversation. The rituals of greetings and farewells may seem quite drawn out compared to the UK; but it creates the best impression not to try to rush through the small talk. Although many executives speak English, it is advisable to conduct business in Portuguese if possible.</p><p>Mon-Fri 0900-1800.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Confederação Nacional do Comércio</b><![CDATA[

Standards are generally very high, and there are dishes to cater for all tastes and appetites (huge portions in restaurants can usually feed two). European, North American, African, Middle Eastern and Asian foods are widely available in resorts and main cities.</p>
<p>The fruits and plants of the Amazon are widely available, such as the <em>a&ccedil;ai</em> berry, served in cafes as a refreshing cool smoothie. Unsurprisingly for a country with a huge coastline and many rivers, fish and seafood are plentiful. Brazil&rsquo;s African roots are strongest in the northeast, which specialises in spicy seafood stews, enriched with palm oil; while Amazonian freshwater fish are often turned into soups or steamed in palm leaves.</p>
<p>Although there is no definitive national dish, the hearty <em>feijoada</em> (a stew of beans, beef and pork) is a strong contender, and there are many traditional dishes and regional specialities.</p>]]><b>Regional Specialities: </b><![CDATA[<p><strong>Feijoada:</strong> A rich stew of black beans, beef and pork, which can also contain sausage, pigs' ears and tail, white rice, chopped kale and orange slices, and often washed down with a shot of <em>cacha&ccedil;a</em>.<br />
<strong>Moqueca:</strong> Fish or seafood stew from Bahia made with palm oil and coconut milk.<br />
<strong>Vatap&aacute;</strong>: Shrimps and chicken in a creamy sauce made of fish oil, coconut milk, and manioc paste, and served with rice.<br />
<strong>Acaraj&eacute;:</strong> Mashed, deep-fried bean fritters often served with dried shrimps, okra, onions and peppers.<br />
<strong>Churrasco: </strong>Mixed grilled meat served with manioc flour and salad.<br />
<strong>Fresh fruit:</strong> Tropical treats include maracuj&aacute;, caj&uacute;, jabuticaba, goiaba and cupua&ccedil;&uacute;.<br />
<strong>P&atilde;o de queijo: </strong>Cheesy doughballs, a favourite snack at any time of the day; the best are freshly made, light, spongy and deliciously tangy.<br />
<strong>Bar snacks:</strong> Finger-licking snacks served with chilled beer, including <em>coxinha</em> (chicken stuffed in mashed manioc) and <em>kibe</em> (meat rissoles).<br />
<strong>Bolinhos de bacalhau:</strong> Cod fishcakes.<br />
<strong>Romeu e Julieta:</strong> Guava jam and minas gerais cheese, a traditional breakfast favourite.<br />
<strong>Chopp:</strong> Draught beer; Brahma is the most popular brand.<br />
<strong>Cacha&ccedil;a:</strong> Fiery sugarcane spirit and often mixed with sugar, crushed ice and limes to make a caipirinha cocktail.<br />
<strong>Batida:</strong> Another, equally potent cocktail, made of concentrated fruit juices mixed with cacha&ccedil;a.<br />
<strong>Brazilian wine:</strong> Try white wines from Santa Catarina and quaffable red Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon varieties from Bahia.<br />
<strong>Guaran&aacute;:</strong> Popular fizzy drink made with energy-giving extract from an Amazonian plant.</p>]]><b>Things to Know:</b><![CDATA[<p><em>Por kilo</em> restaurants, where customers pay by the weight of their laden plates, are particularly good value, with many in Rio and other large cities.</p>]]><b>Tipping:</b><![CDATA[<p>10% is usual for most services not included on the bill.</p>]]><b>Drinking Age:</b><![CDATA[<p>18.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Nightlife" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Nightlife]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Brazilians are a highly sociable bunch, and love their nightlife late, loud and lively. The best entertainment occurs in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Salvador. In Rio, the major clubs do not present their main acts until after midnight. Small clubs (<em>boites</em>) provide nightly entertainment throughout the city. Over recent years the downtown neighbourhood of Lapa has re-emerged as the hotspot for live music and dance, though the favelas' '<em>baile funk</em>' parties are attracting more adventurous party animals - but do not go to a favela alone.</p><p>São Paulo nightlife is more sophisticated, with greater choice and some really unique drinking spots, especially on and around Rua Augusta. Both cities host top international DJs, and have thriving samba clubs featuring live music.</p><p>Salvador, with Brazil's largest black population, offers possibly the most diverse and creative live music scene, from reggae to MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), infused with many other regional influences. Outside the main cities, most towns have late night bars and clubs. A few hours up the coast from Rio, high-end resort Búzios is famous for its party lifestyle, with big clubs such as Pacha and Privilege, and many stylish hangouts in which to grab a fruity cocktail or two.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Shopping" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Shopping]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>In Rio, São Paulo and other large cities, major shops and markets stay open quite late in the evening. Huge US-style shopping malls line suburban boulevards, offering the complete air-conditioned experience, with restaurants, cinemas and occasional live entertainment, though not usually the cheapest prices. Rio and Salvador specialise in antiques, handicrafts and jewellery. The state of Bahia has good Afro-Brazilian art, ceramics, soapstone carvings and musical instruments. Rio, with its love of the body beautiful, is the place to buy fashion clothing, particularly swimwear, flip-flops (<em>Havaianas</em>), and leather shoes, as well as cosmetics and other beauty products.</p><p>General specialities include gems (particularly emeralds and diamonds) and jewellery (particularly silver and gold); Minas Gerais, is the place to find bargains. Belém, Manaus and Santarém specialise in Amazonian items, including hammocks (<em>redes</em>) and wooden ornaments; visitors should be careful, however, not to purchase objects that have been plundered from the jungle, contributing to its general destruction. Manaus is also a free trade zone, selling all manner of high-tech goods, though with the current strength of the Brazilian Real, prices may be no lower than in Europe and the US.</p><p>Fairtrade eco-products are belatedly becoming more popular, for locally produced handicrafts, cosmetics and other sustainable products. O Sol (<a href="http://www.osolartesanato.org.br" target="_blank">www.osolartesanato.org.br</a>) is an excellent not-for-profit crafts organisation, which trains artisans from around Brazil, with an outlet in Rio.</p><p>Travellers should also be aware there may be restrictions on import to their home country of goods made from skins of protected species, particularly reptiles and wild cats.</p><p>Mon-Sat 0900-1800. <br />
Supermarkets are open Mon-Sat 0800-2200. <br />
Major shopping centres also open on Sundays 1400-2000. <br />
All the above times are subject to local variations and many shops open until late in the evening, especially in December.</p><p>Credit cards are widely accepted in shops and businesses, though less so outside of major cities and towns. Beware, however, of extra charges being added, both by local banks as well as your own branch.

The mosquito-borne illness can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The World Health Organisation recommends travellers to Brazil protect themselves from mosquito bites and suggests wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible, sleeping under mosquito nets and using repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 ((3- [N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). Pregnant women are advised to postpone non-essential travel until after pregnancy and pregnant women whose sexual partners live in or travel to areas with Zika virus transmission should follow safe sexual practices or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;Women who are pregnant, at risk of getting pregnant, or planning pregnancy should seek further advice from their doctor before travelling to Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reciprocal health agreement with the UK or USA. Full insurance is strongly recommended as medical costs are high. The standard of medical care is generally very good in major towns and cities. English-speaking medical staff are found mainly in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health care services in Brazil are free of charge, but may only be used by foreign tourists in the event of an emergency. The main hospital in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo is the Hospital das Cl&amp;iacute;nicas, while in Rio the Hospital Copa D&amp;rsquo;Or and the Hospital Samaritano are both well regarded. In the event of a medical emergency, call 192 for an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Tap water should not be drunk unless boiled or sterilised first. Even filtered water in more remote areas should be avoided and bottled water should be drunk instead.&amp;nbsp;Pasteurised milk and cheese is generally considered safe to consume. Milk outside of urban areas is unpasteurised and should be boiled; travellers should also be wary of products that could have been made with unpasteurised milk, such as ice cream. Only eat well-cooked meat and fish and avoid ice cubes in cold drinks. Vegetables should be cooked and fruit peeled.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Bilharzia (schistosomiasis) is present within Brazil, as are several other infectious diseases such as chikungunya and dengue fever (which are more prevalent after rain in densely populated areas). There have also been cases of meningococcal meningitis in and around the Bahia area. Rabies is present; if you are bitten, seek medical advice without delay. If visiting remote parts of the Amazon or more rural villages, be sure to take the usual precautions, stocking up on mosquito repellent, sunscreen lotion and wearing suitable clothing.&lt;/p&gt;</p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="PublicHolidays"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="PublicHolidays" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Note:</b><b>Intro:</b><![CDATA[<p>Public holidays are listed here.</p>]]><p>New Year's Day :

The country is topographically relatively flat; at no point do the highlands exceed 3,000m (10,000ft). Over 60% of the country is a plateau; the remainder consists of plains. The River Plate Basin (the confluence of the Paran&aacute; and Uruguay rivers, both of which have their sources in Brazil) in the far south is more varied, higher and less heavily forested.</p>
<p>North of the Amazon are the Guiana Highlands, partly forested, partly stony desert. The Brazilian Highlands of the interior, between the Amazon and the rivers of the south, form a vast tableland, the Mato Grosso, from which rise mountains in the southwest that form a steep protective barrier from the coast called the Great Escarpment, breached by deeply cut river beds. The population is concentrated in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo. The city of S&atilde;o Paulo has a population of over 12 million, while over 7 million people live in the city of Rio de Janeiro.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Language" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Language]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="Religion" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Religion]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>There is no official religion, but approximately 64% of the population are Roman Catholic, with another 22% Protestant.

Frequent offers of coffee and tea are customary when visiting a host; if invited to someone&rsquo;s home bring a gift. Flowers either before or after your visit will be appreciated, as will small gifts from your country of origin, but avoid the colour purple or black, which are associated with mourning.</p>
<p>Time-keeping is loose and fast in Brazil, so whilst punctuality may be expected from visitors, don&rsquo;t expect it in return &ndash; arriving 30 minutes later than scheduled is quite normal and acceptable. In terms of what to wear, casual wear is normal, particularly during hot weather. Brazilians are known for their love of skimpy beachwear (thong bikinis for women and Speedos for men are the norm) but going shirtless anywhere besides the beach is generally frowned upon.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Electricity" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Electricity]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Bras&iacute;lia and Recife, 220 volts AC; Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo, 110-120 volts AC.

The Europeans saw great potential in a land inhabited by intransigent tribes but rich in natural resources.</p>
<p>Despite French and Spanish resistance, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory in Brazil, finally setting the borders of modern Brazil in 1777. In 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled the Napoleonic wars and declared Brazil the centre of the Portuguese Empire. When King Jo&atilde;o VI returned to Europe, his elder son, Pedro was crowned the first Emperor of Brazil in 1822.</p>
<p>The tribespeople were happy to trade with the settlers, but they balked at the intensive labour imposed on them by the new plantations, especially when forced into slavery. Instead, the Portuguese brought slaves over from Africa, a trade that totalled up to 13 million over a period of 300 years, until its abolition in 1888.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the monarchy was overthrown and a period of political instability began. After a number of rebellions, coups and changes of power, a brutal military dictatorship led by Get&uacute;lio Vargas, gained power in 1937. After WWII, Vargas was overthrown and the country enjoyed a period of remarkable economic growth before a democratic government was finally re-established in 1985.</p>
<p>It was also this period that saw a further wave of immigration, begun in the 19th century, with arrivals from Europe, Japan and the Middle East. The diverse and largely harmonious cultural and racial mix that characterises Brazil today is the result of its history of settlement and integration.</p>
<p>In 2002, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva (Lula) became president, running a widely celebrated left-wing government. He helped establish Brazil as a major international economic power whilst investing in social welfare for its poorer citizens.</p>
<p>Lula&rsquo;s successor, Dilma Rousseff, became Brazil&rsquo;s first elected female president in 2011. Rousseff maintained economic stability and continued her predecessor&rsquo;s socially inclusive programmes until her impeachment and removal from office in August 2016. Rousseff&rsquo;s Vice President Michel Temer was named her successor and is now serving as the 37th President of Brazil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the BRIC countries (newly emerging economic powerhouses, with Russia, India and China), Brazil hosted the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong><br />
&bull;	Before the European conquest, there were approximately 10 million indigenous inhabitants in Brazil; today they number some 896,000.<br />
&bull;	The geographic centre of South America is in Mato Grosso state, near the town of Santa Carmem; odd magnetic phenomena have been reported here, such as driverless cars rolling uphill.<br />
&bull;	The Amazon River carries nearly one-fifth of all the world&rsquo;s surface water.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Brazilian Consulate General in the UK]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(020) 7659 1550.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(020) 7659 1550.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0845-1100 and 1300-1500.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>3 Vere Street<br/>London<br/>W1G 0DH<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Brazilian Consulate General in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 461 3000.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://cgwashington.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 461 3000.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0900-1700 (Open to the public until 1300).&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Brazilian Embassy in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 238 2805 (consular section).</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://washington.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 238 2805 (consular section).</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world&rsquo;s favourite destinations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also one of the largest countries on the planet, with an awesome array of treasures to match. Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Igua&ccedil;u Falls, an unforgettable natural spectacle featuring hundreds of waterfalls, which cascade from the tropical rainforest as blue morpho butterflies flit through the spray.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the greatest draw, however, are the Brazilians themselves; probably the most hedonistic people on earth. Whether it&rsquo;s Rio&rsquo;s effervescent Cariocas going overboard at Carnival, or S&atilde;o Paulo&rsquo;s sultry citizens gyrating in chic nightclubs, Brazilians love having fun.</p>
<p>Their irrepressible joie de vivre finds its best outlet through music and dance. Samba, lambada and bossa nova are Brazil&rsquo;s best-known musical exports, but visitors can also discover a plethora of other genres, from the Northeast&rsquo;s forr&oacute; to the punchy bass of baile funk coming out of Rio&rsquo;s favelas.</p>
<p>Adrenaline junkies can go wild in Brazil; shooting the big surf of Santa Catarina; bouncing in beach buggies over the sand dunes of northern Natal; snorkeling in Fernando de Noronha National Park; or abseiling in the Chapada Diamantina National Park.</p>
<p>Or you can take life easy and let Brazil come to you by lolling in a hammock on an Amazonian ferry, looking out for the occasional macaw, or browsing the backstreets of colonial towns such as Ouro Preto and Paraty, which are lined with architectural monuments and chic boutique hotels.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re looking for, rest assured, Brazil has it in spades.</p><p>From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world&rsquo;s favourite destinations.</p>
