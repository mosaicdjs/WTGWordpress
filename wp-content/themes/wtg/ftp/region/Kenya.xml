<p>The manufacturing sector produces cement, paper, textiles, rubber and metal products amongst other goods. The post-election crisis of 2008, coupled with the global recession, reduced Kenya&rsquo;s GDP growth to 1.7%. The economy improved significantly for a while, reaching a GDP growth of 5.6% in 2016, but then dropped to to a 5% GDP growth in 2017. Unemployment was estimated to be 11.2% in 2017.</p>
<p>Tourism is big business in Kenya, bringing in roughly US$1 billion annually. Visitor numbers reached a record high of 1.26 million in 2011, but then slumped due to concerns about terrorism and wildlife poaching. 2015 saw an all time low of 0.82 million but has ramped back up to 1 million visitors in 2017.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Western business practices prevail in Kenya. A formal handshake (using the right hand) is the standard greeting between men. It is customary to lower your gaze when greeting someone who is older or of a higher professional rank than you. Men should not shake hands with a woman unless she extends her hand first, the business environment is still quite patriarchal. Address Kenyans by their surname and title unless you are invited to use their first name.</p>
<p>Suits are the expected attire for business meetings, though a shirt and tie will suffice in less formal situations. Kenyans are quite conservative and advance appointments are required for meetings. Call ahead if you are likely to be late.</p>
<p>Most businesspeople speak English and it is customary to exchange business cards. Small talk is normal and it may take some time to get to the point of a meeting. The eldest person in the room is often designated as chairperson. When negotiating a price, some haggling is expected, but angry exchanges are to be avoided. If exchanging gifts, do not choose items with a high value as this may be seen as an attempted bribe.</p>
<p>Businesses and government offices in Kenya are open Monday to Friday from 0800/0900-1300 and 1400-1700.

Beef and chicken are readily available, but goat is the most-widely eaten among locals and certainly a must try for carnivorous visitors.</p>
<p>Inland, a local freshwater fish, tilapia, is popular and tasty, while on the coast, zesty Swahili cuisine features fragrant rice, grilled fish and seafood curries with coconut milk and lots of spices.</p>
<p>Indian and Middle Eastern food are available in most areas, and there is a wide range of international restaurants in Nairobi and Mombasa. Tourist hotels provide buffet meals and hotels in smaller towns offer a dish of the day, such as chicken and chips or stew and rice. Sumptuous tropical fruits, ranging from pineapples to mangoes, can be bought seasonally at local markets.</p>]]><b>Regional Specialities: </b><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nyama choma:</strong> Barbecued meat often served with a spicy tomato relish and <em>ugali</em>.<br />
<strong>Ugali:</strong> Maize meal porridge, the main staple for most Kenyans, often eaten with a meaty stew known locally as <em>supu.<br />
</em><strong>Mandazi:</strong> Fried savoury dough ball with a similar constitution to a doughnut.<br />
<strong>Kachumbari:</strong> Spicy tomato relish served with meat.<br />
<strong>Tilapia:</strong> Freshwater fish associated with the Rift Valley lakes and often grilled whole.<br />
<strong>Sukuma Wiki:</strong> Spinach-like leaf often served boiled as a side dish or in a stew with meat.<br />
<strong>Biryani:</strong> Spicy rice-based stew similar in appearance to risotto but with a more oriental flavour.<br />
<strong>Matoke:</strong> Cooked banana, also known as <em>batoke</em>, with a constitution similar to boiled potatoes, most commonly eaten in the Uganda border area.<br />
<strong>Tusker:</strong> A popular and well-balanced local lager named after a famous elephant.<br />
<strong>Mnazi:</strong> Naturally fermented, milky-coloured palm wine &ndash; the drink of choice for many rural Kenyans.</p>]]><b>Things to Know:</b><b>Tipping:</b><![CDATA[<p>Optional.

There are also a few local nightclubs in Nairobi and Mombasa that stay open until dawn; these can get very crowded and prostitution abounds - be sure to travel in a group and take a taxi.</p>
<p>Increasingly, modern multi-screen cinema complexes are appearing in Nairobi and Mombasa, which show mainly Hollywood movies, while in the smaller towns are old colonial-style cinemas showing old Kung Fu or Indian films. Theatre is popular in Nairobi. There is a National Theatre and several small groups of dramatic companies; probably the best-known is the Phoenix Players. Quite often, traditional tribal dancing and drumming is performed in the game lodges and beach resorts.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Shopping" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Shopping]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The city and town centres usually have markets which sell curios such as African drums, old brass and copper items, batiks, soapstone knick-knacks, carved chess sets, wooden carvings of animals or salad bowls carved from a single piece of teak, mninga or ebony. Maasai items such as beaded jewellery, decorated gourds and the distinctive red-checked blankets worn by all Maasai men make good souvenirs.</p>
<p>Khanga, kitenge and kikoi cloths are ideal to use as sarongs (common in East Africa for both men and women), and Kenyan baskets made from sisal and leather are also popular. Most of the tourist areas have abundant stalls and markets selling these items; you will be expected to haggle good-naturedly over prices.</p>
<p>Probably the best market in the country is Nairobi&rsquo;s central market, which lies in the city centre off Koinange Street. Comprising perhaps 100 stalls, it has the full range of handicrafts on offer, and prices tend to be quite competitive. It is safe enough by day, but some first-time visitors to Africa find the atmosphere a bit daunting, so opt for an organised tour.</p>
<p>Though not really aimed at tourists, Mombasa's McKinnon Market, on the western fringe of the Old Town, is the city's oldest, boasting a remarkable variety of familiar and more unusual tropical fruits and vegetables. Nearby Biashara (Commerce) Road is traditionally the centre of Mombasa's textile retail industry, and a few shops still specialise in vintage and other local cloths.</p><p>Mon-Sat 0900-1800.

<p>Over the past few millennia, Kenya has been settled by a large number of migrants from all over Africa, among the most recent arrivals being the Maasai, who crossed from present-day South Sudan in the 17th century.</p>
<p>The mediaeval Kenyan coast was a prosperous maritime trade centre serving ships from Arabia and Asia. Many modern ports, including Lamu and Mombasa, date from this era. The Portuguese arrived on the coast in the early 16th century, followed by Omani Arabs in the 18th century, and the British in the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>It was only in the 1890s that outsiders penetrated far into the interior, resulting in the British construction of the 'lunatic line' from Mombasa to Kampala (Uganda). Nairobi, founded as a staging point along this railway line, became the headquarters of the British colonial administration.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the fertile highlands around Nairobi attracted an influx of European settlers. This resulted in a liberation movement demanding greater territorial, economic and political rights for locals. Led by Jomo Kenyatta, the fight for independence gathered pace after World War II, culminating in the 1950s with a bloody three-year guerrilla war between the Mau Mau and the British colonial authorities.</p>
<p>Kenya was granted independence in 1963, and the Kenyan African National Union (KANU), led by Kenyatta, took power. Kenyatta died in 1978, and was succeeded by Daniel Arap Moi, an autocrat who banned opposition parties outright in 1982. A multi-party system was restored in the early 1990s, but Moi remained in power until the 2002 election, which was won by the National Alliance Rainbow Coalition (NARC), led by Mwai Kibaki, who became the country's third president.</p>
<p>Disputed 2007 elections resulted in widespread violence in which hundreds were killed. Following this violence, international mediators negotiated an agreement retaining Kibaki as president, but installing his main rival Raila Odinga as prime minister. The more peaceful 2013 elections saw Uhuru Kenyatta (son of Jomo), leader of the National Alliance party, elected president.</p>

More than 40 national parks and nature reserves are scattered between Lake Victoria and the India Ocean, covering every imaginable landscape and featuring just about every animal in Africa: from aardvarks to zebras.</p>
<p>As you might expect, wildlife safaris are the lifeblood of Kenyan tourism, and the infrastructure for travellers is impressive. Jeeps, buses and light aircraft fan out daily across the country to safari lodges and tented camps, some simple and rustic, others lavish and opulent. Refreshingly, you can enjoy close encounters with nature even on a budget, with walking safaris run by tribal guides and economic tented camps that scrimp on creature comforts, but not on creatures.</p>
<p>Most people start their journey in Nairobi, but few linger when there are more attractive cities strung out along the sun-kissed Kenyan coast and dotted around the Great Rift Valley. Whether you pick the interior or the coast, with its beach resorts and Islamic ruins, you can be sure to find a national park or reserve close at hand &ndash; Nairobi even has a national park within the city limits, with zebras and giraffes just a stone&rsquo;s throw from the suburbs.</p>
<p>Kenya is also a great place for cultural encounters, with more than 40 different tribal groups, each following its own unique way of life. The semi-nomadic Maasai, with their multi-coloured, bead-covered adornments, are perhaps the most obvious group, but visiting any tribal village is a fascinating and enlightening experience.</p>
<p>On appearances, Kenya would seem like the perfect holiday destination, but tourism has had its ups and downs in recent years, with political upheaval during elections and a string of high-profile militant attacks in Nairobi and along the coast.</p>
<p>These set-backs have made a noticeable dent in Kenya&rsquo;s tourist industry, yet travellers still flock to the teeming plains of the Maasai Mara and trek the slopes of Mount Kenya, and the biggest decision for most is not whether to go to Kenya, but instead, which wild animal to search for first.</p><p>Lions and leopards are just part of the landscape in Kenya, East Africa&rsquo;s favourite safari destination.
