Don't miss the Boca de Inferno (Hell's Mouth) seawater fountain and the Cascada São Nicolãu waterfall, near Pousada Boa Vista. There is also the Ilheu da Rolas (Turtledove Island) – ever popular with tourists and for good reason.</p>]]><p><b>Check out Santo Antonio</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Witness the distinctive colonial architecture and atmosphere preserved in Santo Antonio, the main town of Príncipe. The town is famed for its colonial architecture and its churches, the largest of which is the main Roman catholic church.</p>]]><p><b>Climb the highest mountains</b></p><![CDATA[<p>If you're a thrill seeker who likes to climb, then Sao Tome has two mountains that fit the bill. Pico de Principe is the lesser of the pair at 948m (128ft) summit, while the archipelago's highest mountain is Pico de São Tomé and is 2,024m (6,800ft) high.</p>]]><p><b>Follow the humpback whales</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Watch for whales in July to October, when humpback whales come to the waters around São Tomé.

The capital of the same name is a picturesque town, with colonial Portuguese architecture and attractive parks. It's worth bearing in mind that the wet season usually runs from October through to May.</p>]]><p><b>Take a tour of Agostinho Neto</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Visit the many<em>roças</em> (cocoa plantations) on Agostinho Neto, which is the largest plantation in the country and is a clear example of São Tomé's colonial past.

They became a major transhipment centre for the slave trade until 1875 when slavery was abolished. Then a system of contract labour was introduced, which brought in people from other African countries to work on the plantations. There was, however, little improvement in the conditions of the black population and there were a number of rebellions against the Portuguese colonists over the years. It was not until 1975, following the fall of President Salazar in <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/portugal">Portugal</a>, that the nationalist movement, the <I>Movimento de Libertação de São Tomé e Príncipe</I> (MLSTP), finally forced the Portuguese government to grant it independence. <BR/><BR/>São Tomé e Príncipe maintains close links with other former Portuguese colonies and with <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/gabon">Gabon</a>, <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/cameroon">Cameroon</a> and <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/equatorial-guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a> on the neighbouring mainland. Until 1984 it was also unquestionably a Soviet satellite. However, later that year, President da Costa declared São Tomé e Príncipe to be non-aligned. Da Costa was subsequently involved in mediating the talks that brought the long-running civil war in <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/angola">Angola</a> to a close. In 1997, largely for financial reasons, the Government reversed one of its traditional foreign policy positions by establishing diplomatic relations with <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/taiwan">Taiwan</a> at the expense of those with the People's Republic of <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/china">China</a>. <BR/><BR/>At home, a new constitution was introduced in March 1990 allowing for the formation of opposition parties and the conducting of multi-party elections. The crucial election that followed in 1991 was dominated by the struggle between the former ruling party, the MLSTP and the main opposition party, the <I>Partido de Convergência Democratica  Grupo de Reflexão </I>(PCD). On that occasion the PCD narrowly won control of both the presidency and the national assembly. The most recent presidential election in July 2001 brought a comfortable victory for independent candidate Fradique de Menzes while the national assembly, returned a coalition of the MLSTP and PCD, under the leadership of the MLSTP's Maria das Neves Ceita Basptista. <BR/><BR/>Democratic politics have survived in São Tomé somewhat against the odds. There has been a steady stream of coup attempts, most recently during 2003 when rebels took control of the country for several days. The political and economic stakes have been much increased by the recent discovery of substantial oilfields in Sao Tome's territorial waters. Commercial drilling began in 2005 and the government has already benifitted from the considerable windfall. Menezes has promised to work at clearing the country's debts and then plans to invest in modernising the country's public services.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé e Príncipe in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b></p><p><b>Website:</b></p><p><b>Tel:</b></p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>7th Floor, 400 Park Avenue<br/>New York<br/>10022<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé e Príncipe in Belgium]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>2 734 8966.</p><p><b>Website:</b></p><p><b>Tel:</b>2 734 8966.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>Square Montgommery, 175 avenue de Tervuren<br/>Brussels<br/>1150<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The little-known islands of São Tomé e Príncipe provide unspoiled beauty and isolation from the world, in a way that's now rarely found anywhere else. The islands lie on an alignment of once-active volcanoes, with rugged landscapes, dense forests and palm-fringed beaches, situated 250km (155 miles) off the coast of West Africa.</p><p>In São Tomé e Príncipe, exotic birds inhabit tropical jungles on what is one of Africa's smallest countries. The picturesque town of São Tomé lies exactly on the equator, with a smattering of colonial Portuguese architecture and attractive national parks. The history of the islands, meanwhile, is dominated by the slave trade and slave-worked plantations.</p><p>The main appeal of São Tomé is perhaps its unrivalled peace and quiet. Little more than a couple of specks adrift off the coast of Gabon, the pair of volcanic islands are laid-back to say the least. The compelling Portuguese-Creole culture here revolves around <em>leve leve</em>, which roughly means 'take it easy'. Within a few hours of landing, the thought of rushing anywhere will seem like a distant memory.</p><p>If you can muster the energy to do much beyond laying on the pristine beaches edged by swaying palm trees, you'll find the slopes of the volcanic peaks worthy of climbing for their dramatic vistas, as well as scintillating tracks through the otherworldly rainforest. There are multiple species of birds to be spotted, as well as endemic plants, and the exhilarating possibility to go whale watching. Aside from whales, turtles abound in the waters surrounding the islands.</p><p>A good wander will bring you to both timeless fishing villages and historic buildings from the colonial era. Of these, <em>roças</em>, or plantations, are the most iconic man-made sights.</p><p>The locals are keen to preserve the islands' natural wonders, and so the still burgeoning tourism industry is largely subservient to the ecological priorities of the inhabitants. None of your faceless resorts here. Expect family-run guesthouses and lodges perched on the edge of the jungle.</p><p>The little-discovered islands of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; e Pr&iacute;ncipe provide unspoiled beauty and isolation from the world now rarely found anywhere else.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
