<p>When the Netherlands gained independence from Spain in 1634 the Dutch East India Company seized control of the island, establishing its capital Willemstad on a natural harbour.</p>
<p>Slaves were then imported to provide labour, initially for the salt mines, but subsequently for agricultural plantations and the island changed hands between the Dutch, the British and the French several times during the 18th and 19th centuries, before stable Dutch rule was re-established in 1815.</p>
<p>The abolition of slavery in 1863 triggered economic decline, relieved in 1915 when Royal Dutch Shell built an oil refinery on the site of the former slave market at Asiento. It has been the hub of Cura&ccedil;ao&rsquo;s economy ever since and provided a major source of fuel for Allied forces during WWII.</p>
<p>Cura&ccedil;ao gained self-rule in 1954 as an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles and in 1984, the 30th anniversary of the first elected Island Council saw the inauguration of a national flag and anthem; then 21 years later islanders voted in favour of separate status, which was finally confirmed by the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and the creation of Cura&ccedil;ao as a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 10 October 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
&bull;	Cura&ccedil;ao also includes the uninhabited island of Klein Cura&ccedil;ao.<br />
&bull;	Subject to state regulation, prostitution is legal on Cura&ccedil;ao and a large open-air brothel has been run near the airport since the 1940s.<br />
&bull;	Derived from African and Portuguese, Papiamento is an official language on Cura&ccedil;ao with Dutch and English.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Netherlands in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>1 877 388 2443. </p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/your-country-and-the-netherlands/united-states</p><p><b>Tel:</b>1 877 388 2443. </p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0930-1230 (consular section, by appointment).&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>4200 Linnean Avenue<br/>Washington, DC<br/><br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Netherlands in the UK]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(0)20 7590 3200 ; 0906 753 0313 (consular services).</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/your-country-and-the-netherlands/united-kingdom</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(0)20 7590 3200 ; 0906 753 0313 (consular services).</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0900-1200 and 1300-1700 (consular services by phone).&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>38 Hyde Park Gate<br/>London<br/>SW7 5DP<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The southern Caribbean island of Curaçao boasts a vibrant cultural mix, from the colonial architecture of the Dutch to the mouth-watering cuisine of the Creole. This combined with the natural beauty of the island makes it a real gem worthy of discovery. Think rolling desert plains concealing rocky coves trimmed by massive cliffs, to long sandy beaches flanked by clear blue-green water, while leafy nature trails offer quiet seclusion – you'll find them crisscrossing much of the island. Wander past <em>landhuizen</em>, which means 'land houses', and old plantations juxtaposed near cacti clusters and desert shrubbery.</p><p>The island's handsome UNESCO heritage capital of Willemstad offers visitors a window into the past with its pastel-coloured houses and cobblestone plazas. For the commercially minded, music-filled malls bustle with bag-laden shoppers and cut-price deals.</p><p>Situated on the outer fringe of the hurricane belt, Curaçao weathers a strong breeze that lessens the intensity of the Caribbean sun. It also makes Curaçao ideal for water sports, while the island's stunning coral reef draws divers from across the globe.</p><p>If it's the coastline you've come for, you won't be disappointed. There are some 40 beaches, some of them several kilometres long, with powdery sand that looks from a distance like blankets of silk. You'll also find a number of small coves; often you can claim them for yourself.</p><p>Although for much of the year Curaçao is tranquil and sleepy, carnival is perhaps the best time to visit. A huge party engulfs the island, and more revellers are flocking here to take part in the festivities every year – part of what makes carnival so compelling here is the multicultural vibes of the inhabitants.</p><p>So whether you want to lounge on a beach, explore rugged nature, wander colonial architecture or party until dawn, Curaçao will not disappoint.</p>Colourful Curaçao is a vibrant mix of cultures - from the colonial architecture of the Dutch to the mouth-watering cuisine of the Creole.]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
