Protected as a national park since 1998, The Quill stands at an impressive height of 2,000ft (609m) and you can explore the crater inside. The Dutch settlers first called it <em>Kuil</em>, while the English chose to rename it Quill.</p>]]><p><b>Have a go at watersports</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Go windsurfing or waterskiing; these and other watersports are well catered for on the island. Enjoy the island's superb scuba-diving opportunities. Many wrecks filled with marine life lie on the black sand amid coral reefs and near the submerged old port just off Oranjestad. Dive centres offer complete courses and equipment hire.</p>]]><p><b>Have a wander around the Old Town</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Take a stroll around the restored Old Town. A highly recommended visit is to the Miriam Schmidt Botanical Garden. Named after the founder who opened the garden in the 1990s. It opens from sunrise to sunset and tours are available during weekday mornings and also by special arrangement.</p>]]><p><b>Hike the Mazinga trail</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Staying in The Quill/Boven National Park you can also get on the Mazinga Trail through the lush interior. The trail is teeming with an abundance of plant life such as giant tree ferns, wild balsam and begonias. Not to mention at least 17 different kinds of beautiful orchids, with many rare species. Then there's the teeming wildlife that includes butterflies, exotic birds, iguanas and land crabs.</p>]]><p><b>Party at the Carnival</b></p><![CDATA[<p>It's worth checking ahead, but the last week of July on St Eustatius tends to signal party time with music, dance, food and lots of theatrics. The Carnival was founded in 1964 and for over half a century has been a major part of the island's culture. It's a fine time for locals and visitors and an opportunity to relax and let your hair down.</p>]]><p><b>Salute the past at Fort Oranje</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Catch glimpses of the island's past by wandering about the colonial houses and visiting Fort Oranje, which was built by the French in 1629 and still has intact cannons. Other noteworthy sites include Fort Amsterdam or even going underwater to see the bay's sunken Dutch sea walls.</p>]]><p><b>Snorkel the warm seas around St Eustatius</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Take advantage of the warm and clear water and coral displays by going snorkelling. Perfect for beginners or old hands, there are plenty of dive walls, reefs and shipwreck sites. Preserving the marine life is St Eustatius Marine Park that has specially contained dive sites.</p>]]><p><b>Spend some time on the unspoiled beaches</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Relax on many beautiful and unspoiled beaches with unusual layers of black and tan sand. The three beaches are each different in character. Oranje Bay is good for swimming but doesn't have much in the way of sand, while Zeelandia Beach and Lynch Beach are good for sunbathing. Be aware than none have lifeguards.</p>]]><p><b>Uncover the Jewish Cemetery</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Hunt down the weed-choked Jewish Cemetery, which is connected to Synagogue Honen Dalim, the second-oldest synagogue in the New World. From 2001, this place of worship has undergone a continuing restoration project to preserve the proud Jewish history on the island.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="BusinessProfile"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Business]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="Statistics" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Statistics]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>GDP: </b><![CDATA[<p>US$3.3 billion (2005).</p>]]><b>Main Exports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Petroleum products.</p>]]><b>Main Imports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Machinery and electrical equipment, crude oil (for refining and re-export), chemicals and food.</p>]]><b>Main Trade Partners: </b><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela, Guatemala, Singapore and USA.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Economy" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Economy]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>St Eustatius earns a modest income from agriculture and from a major petroleum transshipment programme, but it is tourism that dominates the economy.

The dozen or so hotel restaurants are probably the best, dining is generally relaxed and informal. Most menus feature well presented examples of burgers, pizzas and a fair range of Chinese dishes. Others specialise in Italian, French or Dutch cuisine; some go for an eclectic combination of all.</p><p>The local Creole-style cooking is particularly well suited to seafood, although there are few dishes that are particular to the island. The pickled conch shell meat, lobster and grilled fish are perennial favourites.</p><p>There are no licensing hours on the island – although most restaurants and bars are usually closed by midnight – and alcohol is virtually tax-free. Most well known brand names are available – a 'Greenie' is a Heineken.</p>]]><b>Regional Specialities: </b><![CDATA[<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> Grilled, fried and spicy stewed fish dishes abound.

Within 100 years, it was the most important transhipment port in the New World, visited by as many as 3,000 ships a year, up to 200 of which could be anchored at one time.</p>
<p>The island has changed hands 22 times since settlement, with the French, Spanish and British ever eager to wrest it from the Dutch. It was an important supply port for American settlers during the War of Independence; indeed, the Dutch administration of St Eustatius was the first state to recognise the United States of America, on 16 November 1776.</p>
<p>This act provoked the British to send a fleet under Admiral Rodney to exact revenge and in 1781 the island was virtually laid bare by British guns. Rebuilt by the Dutch, it continued to be an important trading centre until the advent of larger ships sent it into obscurity.</p>
<p>As part of the now disbanded Netherlands Antilles, St Eustatius (also known as Statia) gained partial independence from the Netherlands in 1954, but the issue of the Antilles' constitutional status never left the political agenda and although in 1994 the islands voted to retain the Netherlands Antilles the arrangement was not a happy one.</p>
<p>Following more referendums a 2005 conference resolved to grant autonomy to Cura&ccedil;ao and St Maarten and integrate Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba into the Netherlands as special municipalities.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
&bull;	There has been a Jewish population on St Eustatius since 1660.<br />

In fact, for a time, it was the busiest seaport in the world. Much-favoured as a tax-free haven, it grew to a population peak of around 30,000. Given St Eustatius' relative anonymity today, you might think 'how the mighty have fallen'. But any visit to the island will dash such foolishness from your mind.</p><p>Bathed in Caribbean sunshine, with only one town, Oranjestad (not to be confused with the Aruban town of the same name), St Eustatius a sleepy, pretty haven from another time. Made up of cottages and waterfront houses, Oranjestad is deserving of a wander, but then it's essential to explore the island's rural hinterland and rugged volcanic hillsides.</p><p>The decline of St Eustatius from the 19th century onwards – brought about, incidentally, by French conquest and the imposition of heavy taxes – has now halted. It's true that this is largely thanks to the influx of tourists.</p><p>Like other countries in the region, St Eustatius became a special municipality of the Netherlands following the dissolution of Dutch Antilles in 2010. The foundations of the Dutch sea walls are now sunk beneath the clear waters of the bay today, though scuba divers and snorkelers can see many of the submerged ruins. Other attractions on the island include walking up The Quill, surfing off the northeast coast, and going on fishing trips.</p><p>The nightlife is centred on the main hotels and restaurants, including dancing and local live bands, which may play one of the two different indigenous blends of reggae and calypso - 'Pim Pim' and 'Hippy'. Leave your troubles at the airport – St Eustatius is all about taking it easy.</p><p>St Eustatius, popularly known as 'Statia', was a thriving transshipment port during the 17th and 18th centuries, becoming known throughout the Caribbean as 'The Golden Rock'.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
