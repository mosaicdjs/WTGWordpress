<p>It is advised not to drive in rural areas at night (or even walk around Maseru at night).&nbsp;There have been incidents of mugging and vehicle hijacking.</p><p>Buses and minibus taxis are good for short hops. Rather than being on a timetabled schedule, they leave once the bus is full, so you're better off buying tickets for any longer journey in stages, going from town to town rather than direct.This way you're not forced to wait for your bus to fill up at each stop. The cost is marginally greater than buying a direct ticket.</p><p>An International Driving Permit is recommended. National driving licences are normally valid for up to three months, provided that they are either in English or accompanied by a certified translation.&nbsp;</p><p>You can hire cars in Maseru. You need permission from the car hire company to take any car over the border into Lesotho and have to pay a road tax. Maseru bridge border post is open 24 hours a day but in the main, they close at around 6pm. Bear in mind that some border posts can only be reached by 4-wheel drive.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Urban" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Getting Around Towns and Cities]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="JourneyTimes" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Journey Times]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><table class="DataTable"><tr><td CLASS="DataHead">From</td><td CLASS="DataHead">To</td><TD CLASS="DataHead">Air</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">Road</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">Rail</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Lesotho</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">teyateyaneng</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Lesotho</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">qachas_nek</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">8.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Lesotho</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">mokhotlong</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">7.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Lesotho</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">mohales_hoek</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">1.30</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr><tr><TD CLASS="DataHead">Lesotho</TD><TD CLASS="DataHead">mafeteng</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">1.00</TD><TD CLASS="DataCell">n/a</TD></tr></table></DataInfo></OutputData></Section>

Its mountainous terrain is cut by countless valleys and ravines, making it a country of great beauty. To the west, the land descends through a foothill zone of rolling hills to a lowland belt along the border where two-thirds of the population live. Three large rivers, the Caledon, the Orange and the Tugela, rise in the mountains.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Language" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Language]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="Religion" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Religion]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Around 80% Christian; mainly Anglican, Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical.

The indigenous tribes that occupied the area now known as Lesotho were ousted by chief Moshoeshoe who established his own stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, 24km (15 miles) east of Maseru. He gained a reputation for his ability to stave off attacks from subsequent marauders and over time, the numbers under his rule increased. <br />
<br />
However, in 1867, prompted by the increasing pressure of attacks from the Boers, Moshoeshoe asked the British for protection in and in doing so, Lesotho (then known as Basutoland) became a British protectorate, which meant being under control of Cape Colony. This caused considerable tension which finally came to a head with the Gun War of 1880, and resulting in the country coming under direct rule from <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/london">London</a>.<br />
<br />
Lesotho rejected an offer to become part of <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/south-africa">South Africa</a> in 1910 and finally gained independence in 1966, a step which has brought its own set of problems. The country became a constitutional monarchy with elected parliament, but subsequent ruling regimes have been unstable, with military coups, governmental collapses and a monarchy in turmoil, which saw King Moshoeshoe II deposed twice, before dying in a car accident. His son King Letsie III is now king and the country is currently under democratic rule by the All Basotho Convention party, headed by Prime Minister Thomas Thabane. <br />
<br />
Much of Lesotho&rsquo;s cultural legacy is tied up in its colonial one, with the architecture of older building in main towns such as Maseru bearing overtones of European influence. However, Lesotho&rsquo;s past is still very much visible in the present and one can still see the cave drawings of the San bushmen and fossilised dinosaur trails that date back millions of years. In the rural areas which are often only accessible by foot or horseback, people&rsquo;s way of life has not changed significantly for generations, with subsistence agricultural farming remaining the main source of income for families.<br />
<br />
As in much of southern Africa, Aids and HIV are widespread throughout Lesotho, with around 23% of the adult population being infected. The government has stepped up efforts to combat the infection&rsquo;s spread, sometimes working in conjunction with philanthropic efforts by NGOs, but it remains an incalculable task to deal with the pandemic and its consequences.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Kingdom of Lesotho in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>+1 202 797 5533.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.lesothoemb-usa.gov.ls</p><p><b>Tel:</b>+1 202 797 5533.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>2511 Massachusetts Avenue<br/>Washington<br/>20008<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Lesotho High Commission in the UK]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>+44 20 7235 5686.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.lesotholondon.org.uk</p><p><b>Tel:</b>+44 20 7235 5686.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0900-1230 and 1400-1530.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>7 Chesham Place<br/>London<br/>SW1 8HN<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Tucked away in the heart of South Africa sits the Kingdom of Lesotho, known to locals as the Kingdom of the Sky and to travellers as the Switzerland of Africa.</p>
<p>As the nicknames suggest, Lesotho is mostly made up of the rolling highlands and dramatic, rugged peaks of the Maloti Mountains, the tallest of which stands at a shade under 3,500m (11,482ft) above sea level. Lesotho is the only independent state in the world that is entirely above 1,000m (304m) altitude.</p>
<p>The high altitude and mountainous geography lend a spectacularly scenic backdrop to the numerous outdoor activities on offer, including pony trekking, rock climbing, fishing, abseiling, hiking, bird watching, mountain biking and even skiing on the snow-covered slopes below the Mahlasela Pass.</p>
<p>The existence of valuable mineral and water resources led developers to build roads through some areas of Lesotho, but much of the kingdom and its villages remain remote and can only be reached on foot, by horseback or by light aircraft.</p>
<p>But Lesotho&rsquo;s remoteness is a large part of its appeal, and this also helps preserve the rich traditional culture of the Basotho people, which you can experience at a number of cultural villages dotted across the kingdom. Lesotho also boasts some prominent examples of ancient rock paintings made by the nomadic San people that once inhabited this area.</p>
<p>Since Lesotho gained its independence from the British, poverty and unemployment have seen this protectorate lose a large percentage of its population to South Africa&rsquo;s mines, while those that stayed behind have had to live with one of the world&rsquo;s highest rates of HIV, which in turn has had detrimental effects on the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>But while Lesotho might not be able to boast the wealth and infrastructure of its much larger neighbour, when it comes to raw adventure and natural beauty it can certainly hold its own.</p><p>Tucked away in the heart of South Africa sits the Kingdom of Lesotho, known to locals as the Kingdom of the Sky and to travellers as the Switzerland of Africa.
