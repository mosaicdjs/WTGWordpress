You could see its main sights in a day, including the residence of the Prefect in the Place de Grenoble, the Canal Laussat, and the Botanical Gardens. The Musée Départemental Franconie and the Musée des Cultures Guyanaises feature good exhibits on indigenous peoples and the penal settlements on Devil's Island.</p>]]><p><b>Canoe down the rapids</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Explore the jungle interior in a dugout canoe. Trips range from an hour and a half to full day adventures and take place throughout the country, including the Kourou, Iracabo, Counamana and the lower Sinnamary. The rivers are a mixture of calm water and more challenging rapids, such as those at Hermina.</p>]]><p><b>Cast a line into the ocean</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Sea fishing is a popular sport, which you can do from Cayenne's rocky shore, as well as from boats in the open sea. Freshwater fishing and fly-fishing are also popular on the lakes and rivers. Cayenne-based Amazon Fishing Tours runs a variety of sea-fishing trips or to Petit Saut Lake, Mana and Kaw Swamp.</p>]]><p><b>Explore the infamous Iles du Salut</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Guyana's most famous attractions is the Iles du Salut archipelago, which includes the infamous Devil's Island, where political prisoners and Henri Charriere's Papillon were held. Do not miss the Iracoubo Church painted entirely by hand by the famous convict Huguet. There is a hotel (an ex-mess hall for the prison warders) on Ile Royale.</p>]]><p><b>Go birdwatching in the Mouragues Nature Reserve</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Discover nature and wildlife at the Mouragues Nature Reserve, which stretches from Roura to Régina and is renowned for its diverse scenery and flora.

You can buzz over the jungle canopy on a microlight plane, or negotiate the winding trails on a mountain bike, with trips organized in Cayenne, Saül, Montsinery-Tonnegrade, St Laurent and St Georges.</p>]]><p><b>Shake your booty at Cayenne Carnival</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Carnival starts after Epiphany and goes on until Ash Wednesday. Every Sunday for over two months, carnival groups in Cayenne, Kourou and St Laurent de Maroni parade to frenetic music in multi-coloured costumes. Mardi Gras is the parade of the red devils. Ash Wednesday sees the crowd dressed in black and white to witness the death throes of King Carnival.</p>]]><p><b>Take off to Kourou</b></p><![CDATA[<p>A gateway to another universe, the city of Kourou is home to the Guyana Space Centre, which happens to be the European Space Agency's main spaceport. Ultra-modern buildings dominate the city; there are several restaurants and a couple of good hotels, too. If you're lucky your visit might coincide with a rocket launch; the picturesque Fourgassier Falls, located about an hour away, are a good place to cool your heels.</p>]]><p><b>Turtle spotting</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Leatherback, green and olive ridley turtles all come to nest and lay their eggs on Guyane's isolated beaches.

Leatherback turtles lay their eggs from April to July, green turtles from Jan to May, and olive ridleys from June to August.</p>]]><p><b>Visit an Amerindian village</b></p><![CDATA[<p>The Wayana are some of the last remaining Amerindian people living along the north coast of South America.

Thanks to the French social security system and subsidies from <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/paris">Paris</a>, the population enjoys one of the highest standards of living on the South American continent.<br /><br />Besides the French Space Centre at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities, occupying most of the workforce. Vegetables and rice are the principal crops, most of which are consumed domestically.<br /><br />Exploitation of French Guiana's mineral resources, which, in addition to timber from the country's extensive forests, include gold, bauxite and kaolin, is steadily growing. Gold production continues to flourish, with actual production levels and sales suspected to be far higher than official estimates. Exploration expanded in the mid 1990s, following the construction of a major new road allowing access to the interior.<br /><br />Development of the service sector, particularly tourism (and the promising field of ecotourism), had previously been hampered by poor infrastructure. The country's other notable economic asset, acquired by virtue of its position close to the equator, is the European Space Agency's satellite launch facility at Kourou. The French Space Centre accounts for a quarter of GDP.<br /><br /></p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Lightweight suits are required.

The southern Serra Tumucumaque Mountains are part of the eastern frontier, whilst the rest is formed by the River Oyapock. Surinam is to the west along the rivers Maroni-Itani and to the north is the Atlantic coastline. Along the coast runs a belt of flat marshy land behind which the land rises to higher slopes and plains or savannah. The interior is comprised of equatorial jungle. Off the rugged coast lie the Iles du Salut and Devil's Island. Cayenne, the capital and chief port, is on the island of the same name at the mouth of the Cayenne River.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Language" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Language]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="Religion" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Religion]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Roman Catholic majority, although there are other Christian churches.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Time" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Time]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="Social Conventions" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Social Conventions]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Conservative casual wear is suitable almost everywhere.

A century later, French settlers moved in, forming trading colony in Cayenne and along the coast.</p>
<p>Under the 1667 Treaty of Breda, the Dutch, who had also shown an interest in the area, were forced out. Numerous changes in control followed over the next 200 years, alternating between France, Britain, the Netherlands and Portugal, until the territory was finally confirmed as French in 1817.</p>
<p>The colony enjoyed a brief period of prosperity in the 1850s when gold was discovered, but afterwards went into a decline from which it has never fully recovered. Penal colonies for French convicts were also built on the offshore Devils&rsquo; Island in the 1850s. Inmates included the convicted murderer, Henri Charriere, who wrote about his brutal treatment in the prison (and his subsequent escape) in his book <em>Papillon</em>.</p>
<p>French Guiana was finally given French Overseas Department status in 1946. However, the territory was largely neglected by Paris, and continued to deteriorate until civil unrest broke out in the 1970s. After a security crackdown, the central government promised various improvements. These failed to materialise until the Mitterrand presidency, under which a series of reforms was introduced in 1982 and 1983. Some decentralisation also took place: local affairs are now dealt with by the Regional Council.</p>
<p>The economy has been boosted since the 1960s by the construction of the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, which was built there because of its proximity to the equator. European and Russian space missions still use the site, which is also one of French Guiana&rsquo;s top tourist attractions.</p>
<p>The domestic political agenda has been generally dominated by heated complaints over the territory's relatively poor social and economic conditions compared to those in France. The alternatives to being an integral part of the French state are self-government and independence. However, enthusiasm for either is lacking, and the small independence movement has made little headway in recent years. The French government has also made it clear that it will not countenance any change in French Guiana's status for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
&bull;	The notoriously harsh penal colonies of the offshore Iles du Salut, housed some 80,000 French criminals during the 19th and 20th centuries &ndash; most never returned.<br />
&bull;	The French Foreign Legion has a regiment based in French Guiana, whose job is to protect the Guiana Space Centre.<br />
&bull;	The original Galibi and Palikur inhabitants of French Guiana resisted enslavement by the colonial invaders, who instead imported thousands of slaves from Africa.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[French Embassy in the USA ]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 944 6000. </p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.ambafrance-us.org</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 944 6000. </p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Visa appointments are available Mon-Fri 0845-1200.

<p>Tucked between the Brazilian Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean, the sparsely populated country harbours an abundance of plants and animals, well protected in parks and reserves. As an overseas French d&eacute;partement, French is the official language. With the Euro as its currency, prices are on a par with Europe, not cheap.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of beaches and swampy coastline, exploration of the jungle-clad interior reveals rewarding sights. St Laurent is the best gateway, an appealing colonial city and former penal transportation centre. Guided tours of the prison are available, and boats go down the Marowijne River, to visit Amerindian and Maroon villages. The welcoming locals have handicrafts for sale, and you can trek to beaches where leatherback turtles lay their eggs.</p>
<p>French Guiana&rsquo;s most notorious penal camp was on the Iles du Salut, which include the infamous Devil's Island where political prisoners were held. Some 80,000 men died here from cruel hardship, disease and execution. Alfred Dreyfus was the most famous inmate, but it was Henri Charriere who recreated the camp&rsquo;s horrors in his book, Papillon. Tours of the restored ruins relive this grim history, lightened up by the island&rsquo;s rich wildlife, including parrots, monkeys and turtles.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, the other major attraction for visitors is the Ariane Space Station, Europe&rsquo;s satellite launch centre. From the small coastal city of Kourou you can visit the centre, and watch rocket launches. Nearby are some decent beaches to lounge on afterwards, or visit the village of Sinnamary, where an Indonesian community sells handicrafts and art works.</p><p>French Guiana is a tropical backwater with intriguing highlights to satisfy the curious traveller: from rich wildlife encounters to cultural curiosities that sound like the setting for a Evelyn Waugh novel, including the launch site of the European Space Programme, chilling ruins of notorious penal colonies, and isolated indigenous communities.
