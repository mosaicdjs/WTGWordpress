Offshore is one of the world's most impressive marine gardens, maintained by the National Park Service as an underwater protected reef.</p>]]><p><b>Kick back in St John</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Escape the crowds on St John, the most unspoiled of the islands. It has no airport, and two-thirds of the island's deep valleys and most of its shoreline have been set aside as the Virgin Islands National Park. If you're looking for a slice of local life, head to Cruz Bay, which offers excellent beaches, fantastic diving and a laidback vibe.</p>]]><p><b>Marvel at the architecture</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Admire the colourful colonial facades, which are a feature of the local architecture. Off particular interest to history buffs is Blackbeard's Castle, which is the earliest fortification in the US Virgin Islands. Other attractions include Fort Christian, built in 1672; the Coral World Observatory; the Frederick Lutheran Church; Government House on Government Hill; Venus Pillar on Magnolia Hill; Bluebeard's Tower, the 19th-century pirate's one-time abode.</p>]]><p><b>Meet the marine life</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Clear, warm waters and colourful coral reefs make the US Virgin Islands a mecca for divers. Some of the best sites include Andreas Reef (on St Thomas, known for its variety of tropical fish); Buck Island Reef National Monument (a protected area on St Croix); Carval Rock (for advanced divers, on St John); and Submarine Alley (an advanced dive site, on St Thomas).</p>]]><p><b>Raise a glass of rum</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Explore St Croix, the largest of the US Virgin Islands. Christiansted is one of the two major towns showing early Danish influence. Outside of Christiansted, on West Airport Road, is the Cruz Rum Distillery where visitors can taste the islands' rum. St George Village Botanical Gardens and Croix Aquarium are both worth a visit.</p>]]><p><b>Set sail around the islands</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Sail around the territory's myriad islands. Visitors can hire sailing boats or powerboats, with or without a skipper. Boat races take place all year round, including the Rolex Cup Regatta (on St Thomas) and the Mumm's Cup Regatta (on St Croix). Guided kayak tours through Mangrove Lagoon and St Thomas' Marine Sanctuary provide the opportunity to see egrets, herons and other wildlife.</p>]]><p><b>Shop till you drop in St Thomas</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Head to cosmopolitan St Thomas, the second largest of the US Virgin Islands. The main town, Charlotte Amalie, is the group's capital. Imported goods from all over the world make it a marvellous shopping centre and stores tucked into remodelled Danish warehouses line each side of the picturesque Main Street.</p>]]><p><b>Take a fishing trip</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Fish for blue and white marlin, sailfish and wahoo; the North Drop (accessible from St John or St Thomas) is the best-known spot. Sport fishing charters with experienced skippers are widely available. Local fishermen are keen to encourage the "catch-and-release" method in order to preserve fish species.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="BusinessProfile"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Business]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="Statistics" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Statistics]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>GDP: </b><![CDATA[<p>US$1.9 billion.</p>]]><b>Main Exports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Petroleum products and rum.</p>]]><b>Main Imports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Crude oil, food, consumer goods and building materials.</p>]]><b>Main Trade Partners: </b><![CDATA[<p>Puerto Rico and USA.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Economy" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Economy]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>When Denmark sold the islands to the US government in 1917, they insisted that the existing privileges of the inhabitants be respected. A result of this is that the Virgin Islands are not part of the Federal Customs Area, a state of affairs that affords various advantages. This, in turn, has allowed the islands to support a high standard of living that they are naturally reluctant to relinquish. <br /><br />Tourism is a key industry, contributing around US$1.2 billion annually to the economy. The manufacturing industry is relatively new and thriving, producing pharmaceuticals, electronics and textiles. In addition, the islands have one of the world's largest oil refineries and a thriving trade in rum. Agriculture is confined to producing for local consumption; there are no significant natural resources. Transhipment and financial services are the islands' other main sources of revenue. <br />The US Virgin Islands are an idyllic place to hold a conference or convention. In St Croix, facilities are available in four major hotels for up to 200 people and in two beach resorts for up to 125. In St John, facilities are available at the Hyatt Regency for up to 350 persons and in the national park for 50 persons. St Thomas has meeting facilities in two hotels for up to 300 persons and in seven beach resorts for up to 850 persons. For further information on conference/convention facilities in the US Virgin Islands, contact the US Virgin Islands Department of Tourism (see <em>Contact Addresses</em>).</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>St Thomas-St John Chamber of Commerce</b><![CDATA[

The US government purchased the islands in 1917 and they are now an unincorporated territory of the USA. A measure of self-government was introduced in 1954, along with the introduction of an elected Senate.</p><p>The four main islands are Saint Croix, Saint John, Saint Thomas and Water Island, but the entire group is made up of some 50 separate islands and cays.</p><p>The economy is driven largely by tourism and the manufacture of rum, although there is some agricultural activity on Saint Croix, the largest island.</p><p>Politics on the islands follow the Republican-Democrat division of the USA itself and from the evidence of gubernatorial elections the political complexion of the islands was distinctly Republican from 1970 until 1987. This is when the governorship passed to the Democrats, who held the post until Roy Schneider, representing the Independent Citizens' Movement, was elected in 1994. Despite the fact that the Republicans did not even put up a candidate, Schneider's efforts to secure a second term failed and he was defeated by Democrat Charles Turnbull at the 1999 election. Turnbull went on to rule for the next eight years before fellow Democrat John De Jongh succeeded him in 2007. The incumbent Kenneth Mapp was elected in 2015.</p><p>Although US President Gerald Ford authorised the United States Virgin Islands to organise a government that would pursue the territory's own constitution as far back as 1976 – and several attempts have been made to do so, most recently in 2010 when the US Congress rejected it – none has yet been successful. The 1993 referendum on self-determination attracted a turn out of just 31.4 per cent and the outcome – a vote in favour of the status quo – was declared void.</p><p>Did you know?</p><p>• The US Virgin Islands is the only area under jurisdiction of the United States to drive on the left.</p><p>• The smallest of the main islands, Water Island has a population of under 200 and was only incorporated in the US Virgin Islands in 1996.</p><p>• Alton Augustus Adams, the US Navy's first African American band leader was born on Saint Thomas in 1889.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the United States of America in the UK]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b></p><p><b>Website:</b></p><p><b>Tel:</b></p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The result of the US Virgin Islands' history and location is a unique blend of Danish heritage and American modernity. Add to that a dose of the relaxed and friendly attitude typical of the Caribbean, and you've pretty much got the measure of this territory. With miles of glistening beaches, first-class diving facilities and verdant tropical vegetation, there is more than enough to seduce even the pickiest of visitors.</p><p>Don't let the name fool you too much. It's true that Americans favour the islands as a beautiful haven from the mainland – it's not called 'America's Paradise' for nothing – and those from the US don't even need a passport to visit. But this isn't just an American playground.</p><p>The Danes' legacy is evident in Christiansted, on the largest island, St Croix, where historic sites include Fort Christiansværn (dating from 1774) and the Old Custom House. St Thomas too retains much of its Danish influence; in the capital, Charlotte Amalie, converted warehouses now house stylish boutiques.</p><p>Apart from exploring the interesting history of these islands, which are situated in the Caribbean Sea (not far from the equally imaginatively named British Virgin Islands), there's terrific seafood to be sampled here, as well as water sports, and of course spectacular beaches.
