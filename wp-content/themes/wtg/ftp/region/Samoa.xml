According to the government, the Samoan is the purest surviving Polynesian type, with a reputation for being upright and dignified in character. <br /><br />Life in each village is still regulated by a council of chiefs with considerable financial and territorial power; this 'extended family' social system is intricately and unusually linked with the overall political system. Visitors should avoid walking through villages during evening prayer (usually between 1800 and 1900). Sunday is a day of peace and quiet, and visitors should behave quietly and travel slowly through villages. It is recommended for women to wear a <em>lavalava </em>(sarong); nude or topless bathing is prohibited. <br /><br />When entering a <em>fale </em>(palm-roofed open beach huts), shoes should be removed, visitors should never stand when elders are seated, and when sitting down, the soles of feet should not be shown (the yogic cross-legged style is a good option). Permission should always be asked before taking photographs in a village. Visitors should not offer money to children, even when they ask.<br /></p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Electricity" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Electricity]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>230 volts AC, 50Hz (110 volts AC in some hotels).

It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1830s that regular visits saw British missionaries and traders arrive and duly convert many islanders to Christianity.</p>
<p>In their wake, it was the Germans and Americans who vied to take control with Britain sending troops to protect its interests. Between them the three colonial powers supported an eight-year civil war and direct confrontation was only avoided by a massive storm that damaged or destroyed their warships in Apia Harbour.</p>
<p>Following a second civil war, Britain and the USA settled their differences and the island group was divided between Germany and the USA. Contemporary Samoa comprises those islands colonised by the Germans, who declared a protectorate over them in 1899. During WWI, the Germans were driven out by New Zealand.</p>
<p>Measures towards autonomy were introduced in the 1950s, before Samoa became the first Pacific island to gain independence in 1962 as Western Samoa, the name it kept until 1997. The period of rule from Auckland, typified by racism, neglect and brutality, carries bitter memories for the Samoans and in 2002, New Zealand premier Helen Clark formally apologised to the Samoan people for their maltreatment during that time.</p>
<p>Political parties in the normal sense did not feature in Samoan politics until the late 1970s when a group of Fono (national assembly) members in opposition to the government created the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) which has dominated Samoan politics ever since.</p>
<p>In 1997 Western Samoa changed its name to Samoa. A year later, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi was heavily criticised for changing the side of the road that Samoans drive on from right to left. The switch led to the biggest protest in Samoan history and the foundation of the People&rsquo;s Party.</p>
<p>The Samoans are very active in the democratic process and since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1991 turn out for elections has averaged around 90%.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
&bull;	Tuilaepa became the first elected leader to represent his country at a multi-sport event when he took part in target archery at the 2007 South Pacific Games. <br />
&bull;	Robert Louis Stevenson lived on Samoa from 1889 until his death in 1894.<br />
&bull;	Samoa has no regular armed forces but can call on those of New Zealand under the terms of the 1962 Treaty of Friendship.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Permanent Mission of Samoa to the United Nations in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(212) 599 6196.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.mfat.gov.ws</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(212) 599 6196.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>800 2nd Avenue, Suite 400J<br/>New York<br/>10017<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of Samoa in Belgium]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(02) 660 8454.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.mfat.gov.ws</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(02) 660 8454.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b></p><p><b>Address:</b><br/>20 avenue de l'Oree<br/>Brussels<br/>B-1000 <br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Samoa offers visitors the chance to experience Polynesia at its most authentic. The capital, Apia, lies on the beautiful north coast of Upolu, the largest and most populous of the country's nine islands.</p><p>In the Aleipata district, waterfalls and white-sand beaches dominate the landscape. A 65km (40 mile) drive from Apia leads to the Falefa Falls, Mafa Pass and the Fuipisia Falls. Indeed, Samoa's natural attributes have an intoxicating effect on first-time visitors – islands' teeming jungles, mighty waterfalls and stunning sea have won many a tourist's heart. Thankfully, there are no colossal resorts to mar this landscape, while the locals are humble and welcoming. For the closest thing there is to earthly bliss, head to Savai'i, a veritable land before time, only a stone's throw from the relative civilisation of Apia.</p><p>The <em>fa'a Samoa</em> (the Samoan way) is arguably the most vibrant living culture in Polynesia, with a heritage that dates back 2,000 years. Only a small nation, Samoa is nevertheless the heart of Polynesia both culturally and, indeed, geographically. Compared to almost any other Pacific island, its hangs on staunchly to the traditional Polynesian way of life. Efforts by 19th-century missionaries sought to challenge the time-worn ways of the Samoans, to little effect. Ruled by both Germany and New Zealand in the 20th century, Samoa gained independence in 1962.</p><p>The Scottish poet and novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, spent his final five years living on the island – his tomb on Mount Vaea is visible from the lawn of his house, now a museum. That Samoa must have influenced Stevenson's most famous book, Treasure Island, hardly needs saying. Samoa is as isolated as it is enticing, much-loved of the adventurous and with a rich, precious culture to boot. There are few destinations as unique as this one.</p>Samoa offers visitors the chance to experience Polynesia at its most authentic.]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
