The settlement on São Tiago was the first European toehold in the tropics and was ideally located as a supply point for slaves traded to Brazil and the West Indies.</p><p>The end of that evil trade in the 19th century marked the beginning of a lengthy period of economic decline. However, in time Cape Verde recovered and re-established itself as an important commercial centre and stopover point on shipping routes.</p><p>In 1951, Cape Verde was redefined as an overseas province, from its previous status as a colony. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the islands were used as a garrison by the Portuguese army, while many members of the growing independence movement fled to Guinea-Bissau, to form the Partido Africano da Independência do Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) under revolutionary leader Amilcar Cabral.</p><p>Following Portugal's 1974 revolution, Cape Verde achieved independence peacefully in 1975, shortly after the granting of independence to Guinea-Bissau, with whom Cape Verde had close political associations. The PAIGC took control of the political activities of both countries and full unification was discussed. This proposal was shelved after the 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau, after which the Cape Verdean branch of PAIGC was renamed the Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde (PAICV).</p><p>At the turn of the 1990s, the Government held elections in February 1991. The Movimento para Democracia (MPD) won both the legislature and the race for the Presidency. The MPD held onto both Presidency and national assembly in 1995, but lost both to the PAICV in 2001, when José Maria Pereira Neves was named prime minister and Pedro Pires elected president by a mere 13 votes.</p><p>Although lacking natural resources Cape Verde is considered one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa with its economy largely focussed on tourism and foreign investment. In 2013 the government decided the Portuguese designation 'Cabo Verde' would be used for all official purposes.</p><p>Did you know?</p><p>Having erupted in 2014 Pico do Fogo is the region's largest active volcano.</p><p>The Tavares brothers, who formed the international hit-making group of that name in 1973, are of Cape Verdean descent. Their hits include <em>It Only Takes a Minute</em> and <em>More Than A Woman</em>.</p><p>Although Portuguese is the language of government, the native tongue is Cape Verdean Creole.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Republic of Cape Verde in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 965 6820.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.embcv-usa.gov.cv/</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 965 6820.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0830-1600.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>3415 Massachusetts Avenue<br/>Washington, DC<br/>20007<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The islands of Cape Verde are a bewitching blend of Portuguese and African influences. You'll see it in the many European-style buildings and the curious musical styles, but its particularly noticeable in the food. Portuguese fare – especially seafood dishes laden with garlic and olive oil – and more African-style fare – such as stews, beans, maize and tropical crops – comfortably combined on most menus.</p><p>Many associate Cape Verde with the mournful songs of Cesaria Evoria, the islands' best known singer. The 'barefoot diva' is the best exponent of <em>morna</em>, a lovelorn type of folk music similar to Portuguese <em>fado</em>. Music is a key component of life on Cape Verde, and several of the islands stage exuberant carnivals, with the best known being the Baia das Gatas Festival. São Vicente is also renowned for its exuberant festivities.</p><p>Once a colony and slave trade outpost, Cape Verde varies wildly in character and scenery through its 10 islands and five tiny islets. From spectacular verdant mountain ranges, to deserted beaches, with a few volcanic landscapes thrown in for good measure, it's the variety that makes Cape Verde such an unusual and appealing destination.</p><p>There's lush and lively Santiago, the biggest of the islands, which boasts verdant hillsides, jungle and plenty of remarkable wildlife. It's also the cultural heart of Cape Verde, home to the UNESCO-listed old fort at Cidade Velha.</p><p>Near Santiago, divers will discover 16th century shipwrecks littering the sea floor, while eels, yellowfin tuna and the odd humpback whale can be seen in the clear blue waters off Boa Vista. The island of Sal is popular for watersports and white sandy beaches, while Fogo is a hiker's paradise, where volcanic peaks tower 2800m (9186 ft) above sea- level.</p><p>Cape Verde may have struggled economically since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, but many argue that it's isolation is a blessing, leaving these islands unspoiled and comparatively undiscovered. Get there before the crowds inevitably catch on.</p><p>The islands of Cape Verde  are a bewitching blend of Portuguese and West African influences, as seen in the many European –style buildings dotted amongst the ever-changing landscape, the unique musical styles, and the fascinating mixture of African and European custom and conduct.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
