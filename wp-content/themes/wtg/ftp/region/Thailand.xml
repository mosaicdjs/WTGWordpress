The best time for travelling is November to March as the monsoon season is over and the hot temperatures of Thailand&rsquo;s summer are yet to arrive.

Farmers and smallholders from the surrounding hills turn up each morning to sell and exchange fruit and vegetables from their heavily-laden barges, as they sail up and down the canals amongst the orchards and vineyards. Trading starts early, at around 0600 and lasts only until 1100, with the main clients being other farmers and the residents of the stilt-houses that line the canals.

The former featured in the James Bond movie 'The Man with the Golden Gun', whilst the latter, which literally means 'Sea Gypsy Island', is a village built out over the water on stilts, guarded by a giant rock monolith.

The earliest evidence of the use of these decorative barges during royal processions dates back to 1357. The barges are incredibly intricate in design, reflecting Thai religious beliefs and local history. The figure on the bow of each boat signifies whether it carries the King and Queen or other members of the royal family. Today, the royal barges, being so old, are rarely used by the royal family; they were last used at the end of 1999 to celebrate the king&rsquo;s 72nd birthday.</p>

However, things slowed dramatically in the summer of 1997 when the Asian currency crisis struck, causing the economy to drop by 11%. After a strong initial recovery, the Thai economy suffered again in 2001/2 following 9/11, and in 2003 suffered because of the reaction to SARS, the war in Iraq and fears of terrorism.</p>
<p>Things took an upward turn in 2004 due to domestic demand and strong exports, giving the economy resilience to the outbreak of avian influenza and soaring oil prices. However, following the tsunami in December 2004, sharp rises in world oil prices and domestic political turmoil following the military coup in September 2006, growth was affected. In 2007 the inflation rate was 2.2% with unemployment down to 1.4%. Inflation rates had a sharp rise in 2008 before falling even more dramatically in 2009. Rates then stabilised between 2.8% and 4.2% with the actual figure of 4.08% in July 2011. In 2012, the economy grew by 6.5% and inflation was 3%. After the military coup in 2014, the economy flagged, but an ambitious plan of economic initiatives launched in 2016 aims to make the country a high-income nation in five years. The inflation rate has steadily risen since 2016. Unemployment rates have remained consistent since 2001 at around 1%.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Most people in senior management speak English apart from in very small companies, or those situated outside the industrial belt of Bangkok, where English is not widely spoken. Most businesses of substantial size prefer visitors to make appointments. Punctuality is advisable (although the visitor is quite often likely to be kept waiting after arrival). In Bangkok, traffic must be taken into consideration when going to appointments.</p>
<p>Deference is always shown to the most senior person in any business situation. The normal business greeting is the <em>wai</em> (a slight bow with hands together in a prayer-like position) or a handshake, but it is conventional to greet those of the opposite sex with a smile or nod. Business cards should be exchanged with the right hand at the end of any meeting. Be sure to pass objects with your right hand and never over a person&rsquo;s head as the head is considered sacred.</p>
<p>Thai hosts are quite likely to give small gifts to visitors, so it is a good idea to reciprocate with a typical national gift of one's own. Visitors should never get angry or raise their voice if things are not going according to plan, as this will mean a loss of face on both sides. Much more progress will be made by remaining calm.</p>
<p>Meetings often take place over lunch and these are generally held in a Thai restaurant. Thai businesspeople are quite formal in their dress but, because of the extreme heat, it is quite acceptable and practical to dispense with the wearing of a suit jacket.</p><p>Office hours are usually Monday to Friday 0830-1630.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Thailand Incentive and Convention Association (TICA)</b><![CDATA[

For many, the taste of Thai curries &ndash; flavoured with rich pastes made from herbs, roots, spices and ground-chillies &ndash; is the definitive taste of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Thai cuisine is a fusion of tribal cooking traditions from the far north and flavours from the spice trade, which reached the country via the ports of the south.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of any Thai meal is rice &ndash; most commonly, fragrant jasmine rice or sticky glutinous rice &ndash; and it serves as a cool counterpoint to the fiery flavours of Thai curries and stir-fries. Not every Thai dish is spicy, but most are &ndash; locals say that something sweet will douse the heat!</p>]]><b>Regional Specialities: </b><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tom yam:</strong> A hot and sour soup prepared with kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce galangal, lemongrass, chilli and limejuice, plus prawns or chicken.<br />

<strong>Kaeng massaman: </strong> A relatively mild Thai curry with star anise, cinnamon, cloves, potatoes and beef or lamb, inspired by Indian and Persian cooking.<br />

<p>Many venues are open all day and late into the night, although bars and clubs are supposed to close at 0200. Sometimes there is an admission fee but this usually includes one or two drinks. The dress code is very relaxed, although a few of the nightclubs do enforce smarter clothing.</p>

<p>Souvenirs such as textiles, handicrafts, antique reproductions, ceramics and jewellery are available; all major cities and popular tourist haunts will offer some or all of these items. Bangkok and Chiang Mai have the greatest range and excellent markets. The souvenirs on the markets may not be authentic, but paddling through the stream of stalls at the floating markets near and around Bangkok is an unforgettable experience.

Amoebic and bacillary dysentery and hepatitis E may occur. Hepatitis B is highly endemic. Japanese encephalitis may occur, particularly in rural areas, and precautions should be taken to guard against mosquito bites. Dengue fever is also becoming increasingly widespread, particularly in central Thailand, and is also transmitted by mosquitoes. Travellers to Thailand are unlikely to be affected by avian influenza, but should avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where they may come into close contact with wild or caged birds; also ensure poultry dishes are thoroughly cooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zika virus is present in Thailand. The mosquito-borne illness can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby as well as through sexual contact. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends travellers protect themselves from mosquito bites and wear clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible, sleeping under mosquito nets and using repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 ((3- [N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). Pregnant women are advised to postpone non-essential travel until after pregnancy and pregnant women whose sexual partners live in or travel to areas with Zika virus transmission should follow safe sexual practices or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.&amp;nbsp;Women who are pregnant, at risk of getting pregnant, or planning pregnancy should seek further advice from their doctor before travelling to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;</p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="PublicHolidays"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="PublicHolidays" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Note:</b><![CDATA[<p>Buddhist festivals are declared according to local astronomical observations and it is not possible to forecast the date of their occurrence exactly.</p>]]><b>Intro:</b><![CDATA[<p>Public holidays are listed here.</p>]]><p>New Year's Day :

A Thai will be greeted with the traditional closed hands and a slight bow of the head - the <em>wai</em>. Buddhist monks are always greeted in this way.<br />
<br />
The Thai Royal Family is regarded with an almost religious reverence. Visitors should respect this. It is very bad manners to make public displays of anger, as Thais regard such behaviour as boorish and a loss of 'face'. Public displays of affection between men and women are also frowned upon, and it is considered rude to touch anyone on the head, point one's feet at someone, show the bottom of one&rsquo;s feet to someone or step over a sitting or sleeping person. It's also impolite to point one's toes towards a Buddha statue. Shoes should be removed before entering someone's home or a temple. <br />

Smoking restrictions have been in place since 2002 and it is illegal to smoke in public establishments such as bars, restaurants, indoor workplaces, public transport and markets. Not everyone complies with this ban, but those flouting the law face fines.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Electricity" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Electricity]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>220 volts AC, 50Hz.

The 14th and 15th centuries witnessed the emergence and growth of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which continued until it fell to the Burmese, initially in 1569, then again in 1760, before finally succumbing in 1767.</p>
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s current Chakri Dynasty began in 1782 when Phraya Chakri ascended the throne as King Ramathibodi, Rama I. The new dynasty moved the country&rsquo;s capital city to <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/bangkok">Bangkok</a> where it remains to this day. King Mongkut, Rama IV, instigated trade and diplomatic relations with European countries in the mid-19th century, as well as educational reforms.</p>
<p>During the reign of King Prajadhipok, Rama VII, Thailand changed from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy following a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1932. The country&rsquo;s name was officially changed in 1939 from Siam to Prathet Thai, or Thailand, meaning &lsquo;land of the free&rsquo;, a phrase used to express pride in the fact that Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to be colonised by a European state.</p>
<p>The Thai military government sided with the Japanese in WWII and allowed US forces to use Thai territory during the Vietnam War. Democracy developed slowly in Thailand and after a quarter of a century of military rule, civilian government was restored in 1973 following the student riots in Bangkok, but this was to last only three years before the military again took control.</p>
<p>The country continues to move between civilian and military administration &ndash; the latest coup in May 2014 resulted in new elections with an end to martial law declared on 1 April 2015, prompting one commentator to note that in the 83 years since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, uniformed or ex-military men have led the nation for 55 years.</p>
<p>King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX was one of the world's longest serving head of state and Thailand's longest reigning monarch, having ascended the throne in 1946. After his death in October 2016, his son Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun (known as Vajiralongkorn) has taken to the throne, although he has not yet been crowned formally.</p>

&bull;	Thailand colluded with the Japanese in the construction of the infamous Burma-Siam railway, made legend by the film <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em>.<br />
&bull;	Although the elephant is Thailand&rsquo;s national symbol, its numbers have dropped from 100,000 in 1850 to around 2,700 domesticated elephants today, and 2,000-3,000 in the wild. <br />
&bull;	In Thailand, it is illegal to leave home without wearing underwear.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Royal Thai Embassy in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>+1 202 944 3600</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.thaiembdc.org</p><p><b>Tel:</b>+1 202 944 3600</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri: 0900-1230 and 1400-1700 (except holidays)&lt;/p&gt;

<p>This travel smorgasbord has attracted everyone from backpackers to billionaires, and visitors can find any level of comfort they desire, from hippy hostels to five-star palaces. If anything, Thailand has become more upmarket as a destination since its backpacker heyday, with air-conditioning everywhere and almost every hotel offering Thai massages and spa treatments.</p>
<p>As well as relaxation &ndash; and what could be more relaxing than a massage on the beach? &ndash; Thailand is a place for adventure. The beaches and islands of the south call out to scuba divers, rock-climbers and water sports enthusiasts, while the dense jungles of the north are a natural playground for trekkers and wildlife spotters. Try bathing under a waterfall in an orchid-filled jungle clearing &ndash; you won't forget it.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the cuisine &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s finest, and certainly one of the spiciest. From fine restaurants to street stalls and night markets, Thailand always seems to have a fork in its hand.&nbsp;Above all else, though, Thailand is a place to feel at ease &ndash; stroll along the sand, take tea with a monk, snorkel over a coral reef, and let the stresses of modern life slowly slip away.</p><p>The attractions of Thailand are myriad &ndash; ruined cities, ancient monasteries, Buddhist monks, colourful hill tribes, floating markets, rave parties, dense rainforests, exotic wildlife, tropical islands, golden beaches and pristine coral reefs.
