Temperatures have been known on occasion to nudge 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), sometimes higher, but the threat of rain is ever present - pack waterproofs as well as the sunscreen. The southeast of <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/united-kingdom/england">England</a> is generally sunnier and warmer than the rest of the United Kingdom, but resorts along the coast get crowded during the summer.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is arguably at its most beautiful during the autumn months (September-November), when rural landscapes take on brown, red and pink hues as the leaves lose their pigment. <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/united-kingdom/scotland">Scotland</a> and the north of England bear the brunt of winter (November-March), but snow occasionally blankets much of the United Kingdom bringing with it travel chaos.

The more popular tabloid newspapers are<em> The Daily Express</em>, <em>The Daily Mail</em>, <em>The Daily Mirror</em> and <em>The Sun</em>. Most papers have an associated Sunday newspaper, though there are some independents. There are also daily regional newspapers. The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) is funded by a licence fee, which all households with a TV set must pay. There is no advertising on the BBC. Commercial TV began in 1955 with the launch of ITV.</p>

<p>The UK's external economic relations were once dominated by the EU  but with the economic rise of the BRIC nations and ongoing financial  instability in the Eurozone, exports to the EU fell. in 2015, a referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU resulted in a narrow majority voting to leave - although many political and business leaders favour  membership, but there was opposition in the country at large. The exact terms, and economic implications, of 'Brexit', as the UK's departure has colloquially been termed, are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Britain was impacted, along with every other country in Europe,  by the financial crisis of 2008. Austerity measures brought in by the  coalition government saw the economy stall, with the UK  suffering a recession and weak forecasts for growth, although unemployment was kept in check.  Banks and big business continue to ensure London remains a financial  hub, but much of the public and political will is in favour of reigning  in the banks with tougher regulatory measures.</p>
<p>The Welsh economy has taken a battering as the UK has battled to undo  the negative economic impact of the recent financial crisis. The  traditional manufacturing and mining industries in the country were  already under decline in the latter half of the 20th century, but the  stagnant pace of economic growth, coupled with a lack of consumer  spending means many high streets are also facing an uphill struggle to  keep shops open, and the service sector has suffered since 2009. The unemployment rate in Wales is 4.1%, and in the UK as a whole 4.8% (2016).</p>
<p>Despite these struggles, the devolved Welsh government is introducing a  number of measures to boost Wales, with programmes aimed at encouraging  new business start-ups and foreign investment, a plan to expand the UK's  broadband network to cover rural areas of Wales, and the  ongoing electrification of the rail network, with the aim of shortening  train times.</p>
<p>In Scotland, export of transport equipment as well as textiles,  clothing and leather has increased significantly in in recent years. The largest contributions to growth have been from the food and drink and chemicals and refined petroleum  products sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the rest of the UK, Scotland&rsquo;s economy struggled to  recover from the 2008 financial crisis but the unemployment rate was 4.7% in 2016, almost on a par with the national rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, traditional manufacturing industries have declined, although a steady stream of government contracts has enabled it to survive in a reduced form. Industries like shipbuilding and textile manufacturing are not the forces they once were. Agriculture has performed steadily, underpinned by the policies of the European Union. The public sector is a major employer (even more so than on the British mainland) and subventions from the British government in one form or another account for a significant portion of the province's income.</p>
<p>The political settlement in the province has presented a number of new opportunities for Northern Ireland's economy, as well as a number of problems. The most important of these is tourism, which is particularly sensitive to political circumstances in the province. However, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland now market themselves jointly overseas under the Tourism Ireland banner &ndash; this is in addition to Visit Britain&rsquo;s promotion of Northern Ireland &ndash; and awareness of what the destination offers has seen growth in recent years.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Business in London is intense and fast paced. Extended business lunches and post-work drinks were regarded as part of the modern working environment until relatively recently. Nowadays, the emphasis is increasingly on hard work and long hours.</p>
<p>British businesspeople are unlikely to be overtly demonstrative - hand gestures and the use of expressive body language will be minimal and apart from shaking hands, physical contact should be avoided. Standard dress code is a suit and tie for men and a suit (or equivalent) for women but varies greatly depending on the company, with those in the new technologies sectors especially tending towards informality. Punctuality in important and business cards should be carried.</p>
<p>North of the border, in Edinburgh, clients are usually well entertained by their Scottish hosts, most likely taken to lunch in a restaurant or pub (depending on the formality of the business) or to a restaurant in the evening. It is not usual for clients to be invited to one's home. If this is the case, however, visitors should take a gift of flowers, chocolates, wine or whisky, the latter single malt rather than a blend, and always Scotch.</p>
<p>In Wales, all public-sector organisations are bilingual but most private companies conduct business in English unless all parties speak Welsh. Overseas visitors should be prepared to speak English during meetings, if necessary through an interpreter.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, meetings are normally arranged from 0900 in offices, alternatively in restaurants or pubs for early afternoon appointments. Visitors should always be punctual and, if formal business is being done, wear either a suit or a jacket and tie. If a late morning meeting is arranged, it is good practice to issue a lunch invitation - whoever extends the invitation usually pays for the meal. The Irish are famed for their sense of humour and the ability to poke fun at themselves and many people take a fun-loving, light-hearted look at life. Nonetheless visitors should avoid any criticism of, or jokes about the people or their culture, and be aware that subjects such as religion and The Troubles can be particularly sensitive topics.</p><p>Mon-Fri 0900-1700/1800. However, business hours in London can be much longer.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>VisitBritain</b><![CDATA[

Travellers from other countries should find out if they are covered by other reciprocal arrangements. Australia, for example, has such an agreement as long as long as citizens carry their Medicare card. Comprehensive insurance is advised for all other nationals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical treatment (at hospitals and general surgeries) to all who are ordinarily resident in the UK, but requires payment for dental treatment, prescriptions and spectacles. Immediate first aid/emergency treatment is free for all visitors, after which charges are made unless the visitor's country has a reciprocal health agreement with the UK. Full details of individual agreements are available from the Department of Health (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"&gt;www.dh.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Food within the UK is generally safe to eat, with health and safety standards monitored by various government agencies. Tap water is considered safe to drink but bottled water is widely available. If you're camping, always boil, filter or purify water from streams.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The UK is not a risky destination but travellers should still take appropriate precautions. Summer temperatures in England rarely reach above 30&amp;deg;C (86&amp;deg;F),&amp;nbsp;but on hot days there is still risk of sunstroke and it&amp;rsquo;s advisable to wear sunscreen, as well as appropriate clothing. The same goes for winters, during which weather can be very changeable. Waterproofs (or at least a strong umbrella) are mandatory at any time of year. Those hiking in the mountains should come prepared, with appropriate gear and maps if needed but the biggest danger comes from those who disregard warning signs or poor weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to walk in wooded or heath areas such as in the Scottish Highlands, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking precautions against tick bites: ensure you wear long-sleeved tops, tuck your socks into your trousers and wear insect repellent. Ticks are known to spread Lyme disease which, although fairly rare in the UK, can affect your skin, joints, heart and nervous system. Symptoms include: a pink or red circular rash which develops around the bite up to 30 days after a person is bitten; flu-like symptoms; headaches; and muscle or joint pain. If left untreated, symptoms can become more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midges are a hiker&amp;rsquo;s and camper&amp;rsquo;s nemesis, especially in the northwest Highlands during the summer. While they&amp;rsquo;ll do no worse than cause a multitude of unbearably itchy bites, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth covering up and dousing yourself in insect repellent to ward off these persistent beasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather in Scotland can change in an instant. If you&amp;rsquo;re walking, skiing or climbing in the hills, it&amp;rsquo;s vital to be prepared for all weathers. It&amp;rsquo;s not at all uncommon to go for a walk on a beautifully sunny day, only to find yourself surrounded by mist and drizzle with little warning. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re equipped with a map, compass, extra food, layers and waterproofs, and always tell someone where you&amp;rsquo;re heading before you set out. Scots and visitors alike also find themselves unexpectedly caught out by the sun &amp;ndash; you might not need it often, but pack some sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;</p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="PublicHolidays"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="PublicHolidays" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Public Holidays]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Note:</b><![CDATA[<p>Holidays falling on the weekend are observed the following Monday.</p>]]><b>Intro:</b><![CDATA[<p>Public holidays are listed here:</p>]]><p>New Year's Day :

One or two kisses on the cheek is gaining popularity for close friends. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small present such as flowers or chocolates is appreciated. It is polite to wait until everyone has been served before eating. <br />

<p>The monarchy, though now only symbolic politically, is a powerful and often subconscious unifying force. Members of the Royal Family are the subject of unceasing fascination, with their every move avidly followed and reported by the popular press, both in the UK and abroad.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Electricity" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Electricity]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>230 volts AC, 50Hz.

<p>The Romans occupied Britain from AD 43 to AD 410 and left behind straight roads, a sewage system and hot baths, amongst other things. After that the Romans, Jutes, Saxons and Angles all established kingdoms south of Hadrian's Wall before the Normans arrived and gave rise to the myth that it was the last time England was invaded. It wasn&rsquo;t. England was subsequently invaded several times by the French, a few times by the Scots, at various intervals by pretenders to the throne and once by the Dutch. The Spanish and the Germans also had a go but neither actually set foot on dry land.</p>
<p>King Henry VIII is not only famous for having six wives, but also for breaking away from the Church of Rome, setting up the Church of England so he could get divorced. After Henry, battles between monarchs, nations, nobles and sections of the population invariably became tussles about how to run the country, culminating in the English Civil War (1642-1651), which was won by the Parliamentarians.</p>
<p>The constitutional monarchy that exists in the United Kingdom today developed during the 18th and 19th centuries as power came to be increasingly exercised by an elected parliament. In 1801 Great Britain &ndash; that&rsquo;s England, Wales and Scotland &ndash; were formally united with Ireland. The subsequent reign of Queen Victoria, whose role was now little more than symbolic, coincided with a period of great economic success and unfettered empire building before events of the 20th century, notably two world wars, resulted in the dismantling of the empire.</p>
<p>In 1920, Ireland gained independence from the United Kingdom, leaving behind Northern Ireland, whose troubled relationship with the UK led to an ethno-nationalist conflict better known as The Troubles (1968-1998). World wars and internal conflicts led to social upheaval, which resulted in universal suffrage, the Welfare State, the repeal of the death penalty and the legalisation of homosexuality.</p>
<p>In 2014 Scotland held a referendum to determine whether it would continue being part of the United Kingdom or not. It voted to stay &ndash; just &ndash; but calls for independence can still be heard across the land.</p>

&bull;	Cricket, football, boxing, rowing, rugby (league and union), tennis and golf were formalised into sports in the UK.<br />
&bull;	The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the world&rsquo;s oldest and largest broadcaster.<br />
&bull;	The Orkney Vole has inhabited the islands for 4,600 years and does not occur on mainland Britain.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[UK Visas]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(020) 7008 8438.</p><p><b>Website:</b>https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(020) 7008 8438.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0930-1330.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>King Charles Street<br/>Foreign and Commonwealth Office<br/>London<br/>SW1A 2AH<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[British Embassy in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 588 7800.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.ukinusa.fco.gov.uk</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 588 7800.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;By appointment only.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>3100 Massachusetts Avenue<br/>Washington<br/>20008<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Few places cram in as much scenery, history and culture as the United Kingdom. It&rsquo;s a busy, eccentric and unique destination; a land of daft humour, tea-and-cake clich&eacute;s and a thousand and one different personalities; a land where thrusting cities like London, Glasgow and Manchester share map space with the peaks of Snowdonia and the colossal slopes of the Highlands.</p>
<p>Four component nations make up the UK, and the end result is as many-layered as that fact would suggest. Its arts scene continues to be one of the most creative and successful in the world, its passions still run high on everything from politics to sport and its overall character is as modern as it is multicultural. Even the food&rsquo;s good these days.</p>
<p>London remains the natural focal point. Its skyline, mixing medieval turrets with soaring steel, is a good marker for the place as a whole. From its markets to its museums, its pubs to its palaces, it&rsquo;s a bona fide world city packed with diversity.  But you don&rsquo;t have to look far to find other great urban centres &ndash; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all home to richly engaging cities full of heritage, music and nightlife. Some, like Bath and Edinburgh, offer postcard-perfect medieval skylines. Others, like Belfast and Liverpool, are handsome in places but just as notable for their indelible personalities.</p>
<p>As a country, of course, the UK&rsquo;s urban centres are just one part of its allure. Britain is often extremely beautiful. Seaside towns, national parks and honey-stoned villages still fill the guidebooks, and the scenic pull of areas like the Cornish coast, Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and the Lake District is as strong as it&rsquo;s ever been. Once you factor in the endless cultural associations that Britain throws up &ndash; from Henry VIII to Hogwarts, The Beatles to Braveheart, male voice choirs to Monty Python &ndash; it stands as a country very much its own.</p><p>Few places cram in as much scenery, history and culture as the United Kingdom.
