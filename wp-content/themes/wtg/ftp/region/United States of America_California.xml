In San Francisco and Los Angeles, however, 'power' breakfasts, catered lunches and coffee meetings are more common, while dinners at private homes are rare. Where alcohol is concerned, it is best to wait and check the preferences of the host. Many Americans stick to soft drinks and Californians in particular are very health-conscious. <br /><br />Non-smoking bylaws are enforced in most of California's public establishments and many Southern California residents do not smoke and are sometimes sensitive about smoking in their house. When making a private visit, gifts of wine, sweets from home or flowers are a good bet.</p><p>Mon-Fri 0800-1730. Though in Los Angeles, job hours are more relaxed and can start as late as 1000, continuing until 1900.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo/></OutputData></Section><Section Name="SocialConventions"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Going Out]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="FoodDrink" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Food and Drink]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>Intro:</b><![CDATA[<p>California has always been a social melting pot, and this is reflected in its modern, cosmopolitan cuisine with an endless variety of ethnic influences. Northern California spawned America&rsquo;s local food movement, with an emphasis on fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables, grass fed beef and humanely raised animals - virtually changing the way America eats.</p>
<p>Food trucks, or mobile restaurants, have become a California phenomena - you can find them parked outside of office buildings, universities, public parks, and sporting events - usually with long lines. Some customers even follow their favourite food truck on Twitter so they&rsquo;ll always know where to find their favourite foods.</p>]]><b>Regional Specialities: </b><![CDATA[<p>&bull; Steak. California is an historic haven for cattle and cattle ranchers, today the tradition lives on with filet mignon and porterhouse cuts at steakhouses across the state. <br />
&bull; Seafood. Californians consume far more seafood per capita than the rest of the country, and fishermen bring 300 different species to market each year. Dungeness crab, shrimp, and swordfish are especially popular. <br />
&bull; Clam chowder. San Francisco is known for serving thick clam chowder in a bread bowl. <br />
&bull; California wines. Northern California is famous for wines and vineyards dating back to 1855, especially white wine. <br />
&bull; Ghirardelli chocolate. Another speciality from San Francisco, Ghirardelli has been making speciality chocolate since 1852 using a unique manufacturing process. <br />
&bull; Sourdough bread. This was the bread made in Northern California during the California Gold Rush. Today, Sourdough Sam is the mascot of the San Francisco 49ers football team. <br />
&bull; Tofu. California is a health conscious culture with a variety of vegetarian and vegan options, including bean curd called tofu. <br />
&bull; Sparkling wine. White California sparkling wines are made in the Methode Champenoise style in Northern California where the temperatures can be cooler. <br />
&bull; Tacos. California shares a border with Mexico and offers some of the most authentic and spicy Mexican food in the United States, especially in San Diego where fish tacos can be as cheap as one dollar each. <br />
&bull; Fruit. California&rsquo;s climate is ideal for growing fruit year around, especially citrus like lemons and oranges. Avocados, grapes, apples, and strawberries also grow especially well.</p>]]><b>Things to Know:</b><![CDATA[<p>All fresh fruit should be washed or peeled before consuming to prevent the consumption of pesticides.</p>]]><b>Tipping:</b><![CDATA[<p>15% of the bill is customary, 20% for excellent service. Bartenders should be tipped at least one dollar per drink, regardless of the beverage price.</p>]]><b>Drinking Age:</b><![CDATA[<p>Drinking laws in California are very strict and widely followed. Individuals must have government ID showing they are over 21 years old to purchase, order or drink alcohol.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Nightlife" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Nightlife]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>There are few places in the world that can rival California's nightlife. Los Angeles is home to an array of illustrious clubs with rich and famous patrons. You can rent a table at an exclusive nightclub, like Le Deux, for VIP bottle service or wait in long lines with the masses. Dress smart and you can get in before midnight. Alternatively, there are more mellow bars near the beach where the clientele drinks draft beer while listening to an acoustic band. For some of Los Angeles&rsquo; famous sex, drugs, and rock and roll history, check out The Viper Room (<a href="http://www.viperroom.com" target="_blank">www.viperroom.com</a>) on the infamous Sunset Strip, where bands from around the world vie for stage time. The bar crowd runs more grungy than glamorous. For laughs, head to The Laugh Factory, where legions of famous comedians get their start and continue to entertain after making hit TV shows and movies (<a href="http://www.laughfactory.com" target="_blank">www.laughfactory.com</a>).</p>
<p>San Francisco, with its young, lively population, is known around the world as a great party town, especially for the LGBT population, with all night dance clubs and an underground rave scene leftover from the 90s. Club lines aren&rsquo;t as long as in Los Angeles, and the dress code isn&rsquo;t as strict. San Diego is the best city to check out independent and local bands who give free (or at least cheap) before they head to Los Angeles, sign a record deal, and make it big.</p>
<p>For those travellers looking for a more sophisticated nightlife experience, Northern California wineries often host evening tastings to the mellow soundtrack of a string quartet or jazz band.</p>
<p>One trend that&rsquo;s happening throughout California is the faux-dive bar: a well stocked and professionally staffed bar that&rsquo;s been decorated to look like something left over from the 1970s or earlier. Think deer heads on the wall, vintage video game machines, and graffiti in the bathrooms. The only thing modern is the high price for a drink.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Shopping" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Shopping]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Some visitors come to California just for the shopping. Whether they are after the latest fashions or quaint handicrafts, the state's vast range of shops and malls will satisfy any consumer.</p>
<p>The boutiques and department stores of Los Angeles are famous worldwide. Rodeo Drive is as much an iconic tourist destination as it is an uber-luxurious street dedicated to some of the most expensive and outrageous fashions in the world. Be warned, Rodeo is not pronounced like the event for cowboys, correct pronunciation is &lsquo;roh-DAY-oh&rsquo;. For some of the best luxury and bargain retail stores in a beautiful outdoor mall, drive over to The Grove: a movie theatre, multiple restaurants, and a farmer&rsquo;s market round out the activities.</p>
<p>Orange County and Santa Barbara are also known for the quality and variety of their shopping. Good souvenirs include bottles of wine from northern California, surf gear and equipment in San Diego, and high fashion from Los Angeles. Street artists sell a variety of art, photographs, and handicrafts up and down the beach through most of the state. Look for organic and all-natural bath and beauty products made in California and sold in most drug stores or gift shops. </p><p>Mon-Sat 1000-2000 or later. Malls close earlier on Sundays.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Accommodation"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Accommodation]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="Hotels" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Hotels]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Whether you're heading to California's cities, wine regions, beaches, mountains or desert resorts, hotels in California are world-class, ranging from boutique properties to upmarket spa retreats.

Only emergency cases are treated without prior payment and treatment may be refused without evidence of insurance or a deposit. All receipts must be kept in order to make a claim. Medical facilities are generally of a high standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of an emergency or accident, dial 911 from any public or private phone to be put in touch with paramedics, fire fighters, and police officers. Stay on the line until the operator instructs you to hang up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many medications available over the counter in other countries require a prescription in the US. Those visiting the USA for long periods with school-age children should be aware that school entry requirements in California include proof of immunisation against diphtheria, measles, mumps, tetanus, poliomyelitis, polio, rubella and pertussis (whooping cough). As of 2010, all restrictions against people with HIV have been lifted.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;All restaurants in California are graded by the US health inspector with a letter rating system that must be hung in the front window. Any restaurant without an A or B rating is best avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food trucks, (mobile kitchens that sell food) are an increasingly popular option especially in Los Angeles and San Francisco. By law, food trucks are subject to the same health code requirements, inspections, and letter grade system that stationary restaurants are.&lt;br /&gt;
Tap water in California is very safe and governed by strict municipal laws that monitor purity and filtration. In 2011, several clean water bills were signed into law that guarantee clean drinking water in California, even in remote and disadvantaged communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the tap water is safe, drinking bottled water is very fashionable, especially water infused with vitamins or antioxidants. Many high end restaurants don&amp;rsquo;t offer water from the tap. Public drinking fountains are available in airports, parks, and schools but with increasing irregularity. Water bowls for pets are commonly placed on the sidewalk by local merchants, especially during the hotter months.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Raw fruits and vegetables should be washed with clean water before consuming for the removal of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health risks in California, especially Los Angeles which is smog prone, include air pollution. Asthma sufferers should take extra precaution and use a mask if biking in the city. Traffic accidents are also high due to the number of cars and motorists on the road. Sunburn and dehydration are common concerns during the hottest months and can be avoided by drinking lots of water, reapplying sunscreen, and staying out of direct sun from ten in the morning until two in the afternoon. Some beaches have riptides and high waves which means visitors should proceed with caution and only swim and surf at approved beaches where there are lifeguards and flag warning systems.

The state is usually divided into Northern and Southern California, though there are isn&rsquo;t a well defined boundary. San Francisco is a northern city, while San Diego and Los Angeles are southern, but the areas in between aren&rsquo;t easily defined &ndash; rather, the distinction is more between the differing attitudes and lifestyles in different areas, than a physical boundary. Southern California is generally a developed urban environment, with major cities and sprawling suburbs accessible only by car. Northern California is more rugged and natural, with vineyards, mountains, and agricultural regions.</p>
<p>California is bordered to the north by Oregon state, to the east by the states of Nevada and Arizona across the Colorado River, to the south by Mexico, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean.  Earth scientists have divided the state into eleven distinct mountain ranges, plateaus, deserts, basins, and valleys. The most notable mountains are the Sierra Nevada range which run north-south for 640 km (398 miles) and contain the highest peak in the United States: Mount Whitney. The Mojave Desert contains the lowest and hottest place in America: Death Valley, where the temperatures hover around 49&deg;C (120&deg;F).&nbsp;in mid-summer.

What's interesting about this time was how native people lived in an area surrounded by mountains, deserts and forests that isolated them from the rest of the world. These extreme living conditions led California's original inhabitants to develop unique cultures, which can still be seen today, as the state has the greatest native population of any in the US.<br/><br/>In the 1700s, after Spanish explorers found no gold or cities to exploit, they left California to the missionaries and colonists who launched a campaign of genocide on the indigenous population. Mexico acquired the area in 1821 and built small ranches and used the indigenous population for labour. At the end of the Mexican-American War, the territory was handed over to the US government just in time for the California Gold Rush, which increased the area's population to over 100,000 by 1850. The increased population and promise of wealth helped make California an official state in 1850. From there, California began to boom and hasn't stopped since.<br/><br/>The opening of the Panama Canal and the transcontinental railroad made California a shipping centre for the rest of the world, while advances in agriculture and farming opened up the state to successful cattle ranches and fruit plantations. With the first decades of the 20th century came the rise of the movie studios as MGM, Universal, and Warner Brothers bought cheap land in Hollywood to build sets and hired fresh faces from the Midwest as leading ladies. After World War 2, land developers began to build estates for soldiers who wanted to buy homes and start families.</p><p>The 1980s were characterised by continuing economic boom as well as urban sprawl and air pollution. The state responded by passing clean air legislation and expanding carpool lanes.</p><p>California can lay claim to being the birthplace of surfing, the movie business, hippies and the dot-com business boom with hi-tech companies based in Silicon Valley, including Google and Facebook. If California were a country in its own right it would be the sixth largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous.</p><p>As it is, the population is growing as more and more people move to California for the weather, perceived job opportunities and laid back lifestyle.</p><p>Did you know?</p><p>• California is home to the highest (Pount Whitney) and lowest (Death Valley) points in the mainland United States.</p><p>• In 1579 the English explorer Francis Drake claimed a section of the California coast, but it is no longer known where.</p><p>• Some 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, although the vast majority are too small to be felt.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Arrive in California and you are opening a treasure chest of stellar scenery, super-cool cities, innovative dining and theme parks guaranteed to unleash your inner kid.
