Two of the most beautiful are Kepirohi and Sahwartik. A 20-minute ride out of Kolonia is the Nanpil River and a large natural pool. On the same river are the spectacular Liduduhniap Twin Waterfalls.</p>]]><p><b>Dive down to a whole fleet of shipwrecks</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Dive at the unspoiled Ant Atoll, Pakin Atoll and Black Coral in Pohmpei State. The state of Chuuk contains famous Truk Lagoon, where a whole Japanese fleet was sunk during WWII. More than 50 wrecks can be seen, some in shallower waters suitable for snorkelers. The island of Yap sees schools of manta rays year round.</p>]]><p><b>Hike to the summit of Sokehs Mountain</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Tackle the moderately difficult hike up Sokehs Mountain, which offers breath-taking views of Sokehs rock and Kolonia harbour. As well as tropical vegetation and an abundance of birdlife, the trek along Japanese Road will reveal anti-aircraft guns, the remains of a power station and a searchlight platform atop the summit.</p>]]><p><b>See mythical creatures at Pwudoi Sanctury</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Eels play a prominent part in Pohnpei's mythological past, portrayed as both benevolent and as terrifying monsters. Visitors can make their own minds about them at the Pwudoi Sanctuary. See the large eels up close in the sanctuary's eel pool and watch the locals to handle the slippery creatures.</p>]]><p><b>Settle down in your own shoreline paradise</b></p><![CDATA[<p>When in paradise you have to hit the beach. Crowd-free bays with powder white sands and warm shimmering crystal seas are the norm in the Federated States of Micronia but the tree-hemmed shores around Kosrae stand out and the charming shores of Yap's Chamorro Bay should not be missed.</p>]]><p><b>Stay the night at Black Coral Island</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Spend a night on Black Coral Island. Situated in the lagoon behind Pohnpei's barrier reef, this small, sandy islet is untouched by the modern hand. Simple thatched huts offer shelter for those that chose to stay overnight, the barrier reef makes for fantastic snorkelling and sharp eyes will hope to spot an eagle ray.</p>]]><p><b>Strike out with a baseball game</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Watch islanders dabble in a game of baseball, which is an archipelago-wide passion. The sport became popular after US marines became based in Guam. There is a stadium in the centre of Yap, while baseball fields in Tofol and Guam boast a national team. Volleyball is also popular among islanders.</p>]]><p><b>Tour the states' historical sites</b></p><![CDATA[<p>See the states' most important historical sites: the pretty German-built Catholic Bell Tower in Pohnpei; the Japanese Wartime Communication Centre at Xavier High School in Chuuk; and the ancient ruins of Insaru in Kosrae. Dating back to 1,300 AD, the ballast blocks were once an important city.</p>]]><p><b>Visit the Venice of Micronesia, Nan Madol</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Located off the eastern shore of Pohnpei, Nan Madol is considered an ancient feat of engineering. The ruins are atop artificial islands intercut by a series of canals and have been set in place without pulleys, levers or other such modern techniques. Explore the remains of what were once bathhouses, temples and burial sites.</p>]]><p><b>Visit the remains of Micronesia's colonial past</b></p><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Spanish Wall acts as the outer boundary to a baseball pitch but they were originally the ramparts of the Fort Alphonso XII erected following a local uprising. A nod to the island's Spanish colonisation of the late 19th-century, the wall is one of only a few colonial sites that remain.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="BusinessProfile"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Business]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="Statistics" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Statistics]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>GDP: </b><![CDATA[<p>US$232 million (2005).</p>]]><b>Main Exports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Fish, garments, banana, kava and betel nut.</p>]]><b>Main Imports: </b><![CDATA[<p>Food and manufactured goods.</p>]]><b>Main Trade Partners: </b><![CDATA[<p><a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/japan">Japan</a>, USA, <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/china/hong-kong/hong-kong-international-airport">Hong Kong</a> and <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guam">Guam</a>.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Economy" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Economy]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Subsistence farming and fishing are of declining importance as tourism has come to dominate the domestic economy and fishing is largely pursued by foreign commercial concerns operating under licence. Mineral resources are limited to a few high-grade phosphate deposits. Sales of these licences account for over one-third of national income.<br />
<br />
Aid from the <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/united-states-america">USA</a> has been a vital source of income: under the Compact of Free Association with the USA, which was amended in 2004, the Federated States of Micronesia will continue to receive millions of dollars in annual aid until 2023. The compact also established a Trust Fund that will eventually provide the islands with annual payments in perpetuity. However, the decline in US help has depressed the economy. Growth was just 0.3% in 2005, while inflation was 2.2%. Unemployment was measured at about 22% in 2000.<br />
<br />
The Federated States of Micronesia is a member of the South Pacific Commission and the South Pacific Forum. The main industries the FSM profit from are tourism, construction, specialised aquaculture, wood, pearls and craft items from shells.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="Business" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Etiquette]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Mon-Fri 0800-1200 and 1300-1700.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="CommercialInfo" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Business Contacts]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><b>The Pohnpei State Chamber of Commerce</b><![CDATA[

<br />
<em>Sakau</em>, as it is known on Pohnpei, or kava, as it is known throughout the rest of Polynesia, is made from the root of a shrub which yields a mildly narcotic substance when squeezed through hibiscus bark.

This followed successive colonisation by the Portuguese, Spanish and Germans, and latterly Japanese rule between the two World Wars, under a mandate from the League of Nations (a forerunner of the United Nations). In November 1986, the Federated States signed a Compact of Free Association with the <a class="internal" href="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/united-states-america">USA</a>, allowing for near-independence with US defence support. Admission to and support from the South Pacific Forum  an association that groups Australasia with the smaller Pacific island nations  has been particularly valuable. Other than political matters, successive governments  including the present administration of Premier Leo Falcam, elected in 1999  have been pre-occupied with the economic situation, as the Federated States suffer from remoteness and lack of industry and infrastructure. There is some development potential, particularly in the fishing and fish-processing industry, but Micronesia has some way to go before it ceases to be dependent on aid from the USA, which amounted to US$1.3 billion between 1986 and the end of the last century. In 1991, the Federated States of Micronesia were admitted to the UN.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Federated States of Micronesia in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 223-4383</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.fsmembassydc.org/</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 223-4383</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri 0900-1700.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>1725 N Street<br/>Washington<br/>20036<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>Scattered across the Pacific Ocean, the Federated States of Micronesia is the epitome of paradise &ndash; with its powdery shores, crystalline waters and colourful coral reefs &ndash; but its lack of connectivity and relative obscurity means few travellers actually make it here.</p>
<p>Comprised of some 607 islands, this archipelago is not the easiest place to get to, but it certainly rewards those who do make the journey. In islands like Chuuk, visitors will find vast lagoons of monumental beauty, filled with shipwrecks, kaleidoscopic corals and sandy beaches. The islands are a dream for divers, and many argue that the area&rsquo;s diving and snorkelling ranks among the best in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about natural beauty, though. The Micronesians themselves combine a profusion of languages, customs and folklore, which are captivating to witness. The archipelago is defiantly archaic too, which is wholly refreshing: on the island of Yap, islanders still trade using an ancient stone currency. Some Micronesians can also be glimpsed wearing traditional garments and throughout the nation you are likely to stumble across snatches of unique island music and witness zesty, time-honoured dances.</p>
<p>Though a sovereign nation now, the archipelago has been dragged from pillar to post by various colonial powers. The Portuguese, Spanish, Germans and Japanese have all laid claim to the territory, followed by the USA, which took over the administration the nation in 1947. However, in 1986, the Federated States signed a Compact of Free Association with the USA, allowing for independence with US defence support.</p>
<p>The islands suffer from remoteness and lack of industry and infrastructure. There is development potential, but as yet Micronesia remains dependent on US aid. Tourism is one industry that could potentially boost the island's fiscal situation. However, even if tourism does take off, with 607 islands to speak of, finding some deserted shores to relax on shouldn't be too hard.</p><p>Scattered across the Pacific Ocean, the Federated States of Micronesia is the epitome of paradise &ndash; with its powdery shores, crystalline waters and colourful coral reefs &ndash; but its lack of connectivity and relative obscurity means few travellers actually make it here.</p>
<p>Comprised of some 607 islands, this archipelago is not the easiest place to get to, but it certainly rewards those who do make the journey. In islands like Chuuk, visitors will find vast lagoons of monumental beauty, filled with shipwrecks, kaleidoscopic corals and sandy beaches. The islands are a dream for divers, and many argue that the area&rsquo;s diving and snorkelling ranks among the best in the world.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section></Region></WTG>
