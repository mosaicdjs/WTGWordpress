Fierce resistance to colonisation deterred most would-be occupiers from Europe, although the territory changed hands many times between the Dutch, British and French before being confirmed as a Dutch possession by the 1815 Treaty of Vienna.</p>
<p>At this time, the majority of the population were slaves working on plantations and despite the abolition of slavery in 1863, conditions altered very little until the early 20th century and the discovery of large bauxite deposits, which brought about a major change in the economic and political complexion of the country.</p>
<p>In 1954, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles became autonomous regions within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. When full independence was achieved in 1975 the new country's political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines &ndash; descendants of the black slave workforce, Indonesians, Indians, mixed-race Creoles and a small European contingent. The ensuing coalition governments tended to destabilise the political process and in February 1980, the coalition that had taken power in 1975 was overthrown by a popular military coup.</p>
<p>The new regime, under Lt-Col Desi Bouterse, cultivated close links with Cuba at the expense of those with the Netherlands. Then came a civil war, which broke out between the regime and jungle-based dissidents. The economic burden of the war prompted the military regime to return to civilian rule and a democratic constitution was agreed in March 1987 (a ceasefire with the guerrillas was finally reached in 1992).</p>
<p>After a dispute with elected President Ransewak Shankar in 1990, Desi Bouterse dismissed the government (by telephone!) and put the military back in charge before further elections in 1991. As his power waned in the 1990s Bouterse was convicted in absentia on drug smuggling charges in the Netherlands and sentenced to 11 years in prison.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly the Dutch government said it would only maintain necessary contact with Desi Bouterse when he was elected as Suriname&rsquo;s president in July 2010, a position he continues to hold.</p>

&bull;	Although the official spelling of the country&rsquo;s English name was changed to &lsquo;Suriname&rsquo; in 1978, &lsquo;Surinam&rsquo; is still found, notably by the national airline.<br />
&bull;	Suriname is the only Dutch speaking country in South America.<br />
&bull;	Suriname and neighbouring Guyana are South America&rsquo;s only countries that drive on the left.</p>]]></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="ContactAddresses"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Contact Addresses]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Republic of Surinam in the USA]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 244 7488.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.surinameembassy.org</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(202) 244 7488.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Mon-Fri: 0800-1600; 1000-1300 and 1400-1500 (visas).&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>NW<br/>4301 Connecticut Avenue,Suite 460<br/>Washington<br/>20008<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData><OutputData Name="UsefulAddress" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Embassy of the Republic of Surinam in The Netherlands]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><p><b>Tel:</b>(70) 365 0844.</p><p><b>Website:</b>http://www.consulaatsuriname.nl/</p><p><b>Tel:</b>(70) 365 0844.</p><p><b>Opening Times:</b>&lt;p&gt;Tues 1000-1300, Wed 0700-1000, Thurs 0800-1030, Fri 1100-1330, Sat 0800-1400, Sun 1100-1330.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Address:</b>3-650844<br/>Alexander Gogelweg 2<br/>The Hague<br/>2517 JH<br/></p></DataInfo></OutputData></Section><Section Name="Overview"><SectionTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></SectionTitle><OutputData Name="CountryOverview" ContentTypeID=""><DataTitle><![CDATA[Overview]]></DataTitle><DataInfo><![CDATA[<p>The smallest of the Guyanas (the collective term for Guyana, French Guyana and Surinam), this diminutive destination may only have half a million odd inhabitants, but it&rsquo;s the liveliest of these onetime colonial backwaters. It&rsquo;s also often overlooked by travellers, which is their loss because Surinam has much to offer.</p>
<p>The country is culturally fascinating. Languages spoken include Dutch, Creole, Chinese and English, which reflects the vibrant ethnic mix of its people. It&rsquo;s also extraordinarily beautiful: the capital city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and its tropical forests are full of wildlife, with an impressive one third of the country protected in nature reserves.</p>
<p>The 17th-century UNESCO capital, Paramaribo, is a good starting point for any trip. Home to a sumptuous collection of wooden colonial buildings, which line the waterfront, the city also lays claim to Central Market, a high-energy bazaar selling everything from quack medicine to fresh fish. At night you can dine on fresh seafood in local restaurants and cut shapes in lively bars, which are far removed from the tranquillity of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Surinam's main attraction is its tropical rainforest, which covers nearly 80% of the country and harbours a huge variety of wildlife. Ecotourism is well developed here and some of the best lodges in South America can be found in the country&rsquo;s jungle. With its intricate lattice of rivers, boat is the best way to get around the rainforest and you can take tours to see nesting leatherback turtles or search for other exotic creatures, including Amazon river dolphins, monkeys and, if you&rsquo;re really lucky, a jaguar.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s diverse cultural roots have also been well preserved: communities of Amerindians and Maroons &ndash; descendants of former African slaves &ndash; lie deep in the jungle, offering visitors an insight into their lifestyle, harmoniously adapted to their environment. Back in the cities, the busy festival calendar covers an eclectic range of events including jazz jamborees, Easter Carnival and exuberant Christmas parties, which climax on New Year&rsquo;s Eve with the legendary Surifesta. It&rsquo;s a wild and wonderful celebration.
