The 86 rooms are pretty well worn and not all electrical outlets  faucets or lights may be working. But there's a small rooftop pool  the famous Pico Blanco disco on the top floor  and some rooms have sea views  which allows many guests (especially students and younger travellers  who favour this place) to overlook the shabbiness.</p>

The rooms are rough around the edges  however; best to check one out before checking in. The lobby is always abuzz with live music  clinking cocktail glasses and laughter.</p>

The seawater pool here and lobby bar are attractions in themselves.</p>
