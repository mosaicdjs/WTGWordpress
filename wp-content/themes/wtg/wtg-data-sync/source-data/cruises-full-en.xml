								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It's the coldest and windiest place on earth, cut off from civilisation by Drake's Passage, 1,000km (621 miles) of treacherous sea that would strike fear into the hearts of sailors in days gone by.<br /><br />Yet the White Continent has also become one of the <strong>must-see</strong> destinations for adventurous tourists keen to tick off the last continent and see the vast wilderness that has spawned so many famous explorers over the past 100 years - including Amundsen, Cook and Shackleton.<br /><br />It's a land of snow-capped mountains, dramatic rock formations and ice fjords, so cold that no plant life can exist and only a few birds and mammals survive. In summer, from November to March, there are floating <strong>icebergs</strong> the size of six-storey buildings; come winter the sea freezes into a layer up to two metres thick, effectively doubling the size of the continent.<br /><br />Tourists can visit the White Continent on <strong>exploration-style cruise ships</strong> that sail around the Antarctic Peninsula, stopping at key sights so passengers can visit colonies of penguins, have a dip in the volcano-heated waters off Pendulum Cove in Deception Island or take a boat ride around giant icebergs in inflatable Zodiacs.<br /><br />Typically, Antarctic cruises leave and return to <strong><a href="/i/ushuaia">Ushuaia</a></strong>, at the southern-most tip of <a href="/i/argentina">Argentina</a>, for 10-night cruises that visit all the top spots, although there are longer cruises that also visit the <a href="/i/falkland-islands">Falkland Islands</a>.<br /><br />As well as Deception Island, there are often landings on King George Island, home to elephant seals, Adélie and chinstrap penguins, skuas, petrels and other birds, and Paradise Bay, where gentoo penguins live surrounded by imposing mountains and creeping glaciers.<br /><a href="/i/antarctica-0">Antarctica</a> is the most <strong>remote</strong> place on earth; a frozen world more than 50 times the size of the <a href="/i/united-kingdom">UK</a> that spends half the year in total darkness.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Sightseeing in Antarctica is not like visiting a big city or ancient monument. There are no restaurants or bars, no souvenir shops - although some scientists set up stalls for visiting tourists, selling maps and home-drawn pictures - and no old relics to see.<br /><br />Antarctica is all about scenery and wildlife, which is carefully protected to make sure the natural splendour of the region isn't compromised. Only 100 passengers are allowed on land at a time, and then only for a limited period, sometimes just an hour, depending on the size of the ship.<br /><br />Cruise ships have set itineraries, but Antarctica's weather is notorious, changing from glorious sunshine to a complete white-out in seconds, from clear water to thick ice floes in minutes, so captains navigate according to the conditions.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• Take a dip in the thermal waters on <strong>Deception</strong><strong> Island</strong>. The island you see today was formed by a volcanic eruption, which caused its peak to explode and left a huge caldera (crater) inside the island. The volcano is still active - the last eruption was 1991-92. Marine animals stay away from the caldera because the water is too warm but huge numbers of penguins live on the rocks.<br /><br />• Look out for penguins at <strong>Half-Moon</strong><strong> Island</strong>. It's only 2-km (1.3-miles) long, but the island has some dramatic rock formations, multi-coloured lichens and a large population of chinstrap penguins, which nest on the wind-swept outcrops of rock. Whales are often spotted patrolling the shores.<br /><br />• Be on deck for a scenic cruise through the <strong>Lemaire Channel</strong>, a narrow passage -1,600m (5,249ft) at its widest point - separating the Antarctic Peninsula and Booth Island. The channel is often nicknamed Kodak Gap because the scenery is so stunning: steep cliffs, mountain peaks, icebergs, as well as the chance to spot minke or humpback whales.<br /><br />• Walk among the world's southernmost colony of gentoo penguins on <strong>Petermann</strong><strong> Island</strong>. Ships reach the island through the Lemaire Channel provided the latter is not blocked with icebergs. The 2-km (1.6-mile) long island is also home to a colony of Adélie penguins.<br /><br />• Get kitted out in coats, boots and hats for a landing in <strong>Paradise</strong><strong> Harbour</strong>, one of the most aptly-named places in Antarctica, with glaciated mountains and ice cliffs affording protection to the harbour. Most cruise ships take passengers ashore here, to walk amid the gentoo penguin colony.<br /><br />• Have cameras at the ready for a cruise through the <strong>Gerlache Strait</strong>. The strait separates the Palmer Archipelago from the Antarctic Peninsula and is a popular spot with visiting cruise ships as it's a favourite hangout for humpback and minke whales, chinstrap penguins and leopard seals.<br /><br />• See the light with the <strong>halo phenomenon</strong>. Halo displays occur frequently in Antarctica and are an atmospheric happening caused by the refraction of light by ice crystals. They are particularly bright when they form in diamond dust. The most common halo shows as a rainbow circle around the sun, sometimes with a secondary circle around it.<br /><br />• See <strong>Elephant</strong><strong> Island</strong><strong>,</strong> where 21 of Sir Ernest Shackleton's crew lived for four months in 1916 while their leader went for help. The crew lived under an upturned boat, surviving on seal blubber, never knowing if help would arrive. The island is named for its large colony of elephant seals, but also has a large colony of penguins.</p>]]></Sightseeing>
								<TransferNotes><![CDATA[Landings are made at Deception Island, Paradise Harbour and Half-Moon Island - all by inflatable Zodiacs (there are no piers or terminals in the Antarctic) - and most cruise ships also sail down 'iceberg alley' (so named for the giant 'bergs that line the route), through the Gerlache Strait and Lemaire Channel. Most cruisers go to Elephant Island.]]></TransferNotes>

<br />
Originally discovered by Christopher Columbus, <strong>Isla Margarita</strong> is a tropical gem waiting to be explored. It is a large island of high forested mountains, which give way to palm fringed<strong> beaches</strong> and turquoise sea. Opportunities for eco-adventures and activities abound in this island paradise and its spectacular beaches will fail to disappoint.<br />
<br />
A tropical paradise set off the northeast coast of <strong><a href="/i/venezuela">Venezuela</a></strong>, Isla Margarita is a haven for sun-worshippers and watersport enthusiasts alike.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Cruise ships dock at El Guamache where a tourism development has sprung up but visitors will want to explore a little further on day trips to other parts of the island. Most people will visit to laze on the beach but those with a bit of energy will enjoy its many natural attractions. As well as white sand beaches and scenic landscapes, visitors have the opportunity to view wildlife above and below the water in the island's forests and marine parks. Trekking, horse riding, diving, snorkelling, windsurfing and kitesurfing all accessible activities.<br />

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Shoppers flock to Isla de Margarita, particularly the town of Porlamar, to take advantage of the island's duty-free status. The shopping malls are lined with shops selling clothes and consumer goods at cheap prices. At El Guamache passengers from cruise ships can pick up souvenirs and locally made handicrafts including glass jewellery, terracotta pottery and multicoloured ceramic fishes.</p>]]></Shopping>

								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Margarita Island is warm and pleasant all-year round, with the worst of the heat alleviated by sea breezes. The rainy season is November to January.

						<Content>
							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Cruising into Cartagena is like sailing back in time. The old, colonial heart of the city is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its forbidding fortresses and crumbling colonial buildings sit side by side with cobbled streets and humble shops. It's a colourful city with a vibrant atmosphere and lively nightlife.<br />
<br />
Often referred to as one of the most beautiful cities in <a href="/i/south-america">South America</a>, Cartagena is the jewel in <a href="/i/colombia">Colombia</a>'s tourism crown. The city sparkles on the edge of the Caribbean, where the turquoise sea laps palm tree lined beaches beneath the old city walls. Its streets are lined with historic buildings, and each twist and turn leads the visitor into an alleyway of discovery.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The walled city is compact and easy to explore on foot. The cobble-stoned streets are lined with multi-coloured houses with tiled roofs, wooden balconies and flowered courtyards. These are interspersed with grand buildings dating back to the early days of Spanish rule. A good place to start is the Cathedral - its domed tower can be seen for miles around. Construction started in 1575 but it was not finished for another half a century, thanks in part to an attack by British ships led by Sir Francis Drake. Nearby are other important, historic buildings, including several notable museums.It is bordered on three sides by the Caribbean sea and has some excellent beaches and watersports options including sailing and diving.<br /><strong><br />Highlights<br /></strong>• Iglesia de Santo Domingo (oldest church in the city)<br />• Museo de Oro y Arqueloguía (gold museum)<br />• Las Bóvedas (former dungeons now filled with tourist boutiques)<br />• Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas (hilltop fortress)<br />• Islas del Rosario (coral islands)</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Goods to look out for include gold jewellery, antiques and leather products. Colombia produces first-grade precious stones, and its emeralds are among the most perfect in the world. Local arts and crafts are available in markets and boutiques throughout the city, and designer shops exist for well-heeled locals and visitors.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Seafood is an obvious choice - fresh produce straight from sea is infused with flavours of the Caribbean. But there are cafés and restaurants to cater for most tastes. The Portal de los Dulces is great for sweet treats.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>The climate is hot and tropical, although a sea breeze in the evening cools things off a bit. The city's proximity to the equator means the temperature is fairly constant throughout the year and rarely drops below 30°C during the day. The driest months are December to April.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Most sites of interest are within easy reach of the cruise ship terminus, including Manaus Cathedral which is just outside the port. Although it is a big city the downtown area is an easy and pleasant place to walk around. The city's key attraction is the Teatro Amazonas<em> </em>(Amazon Theatre) - a grand, Italian Renaissance style opera house built in 1896.<br />
<br />
Manaus boasts many fine museums detailing the history of the Amazon and its people. But the main draws are the ecological attractions, many of which are accessible by river boat.

							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>This sprawling city is known as the '<a href="/i/venice">Venice</a> of <a href="/i/brazil">Brazil</a>' on account of the canals and waterways which crisscross the city. As well as the historic old city of colonial buildings and churches, and a business district of high-rise office blocks and shopping malls, Recife boasts many fine <strong>beaches</strong>.<br />
<br />
Recife a bustling city of commerce and culture in Brazil's northeast which takes its name from the Portuguese word for reef, due to the city's location behind a protective <strong>coral reef</strong>. Beach life is popular here but not as all pervading as it is in Rio. A melting pot of cultures, with&nbsp;<strong>indigenous people</strong>, early settlers and slaves all represented, has made Recife&nbsp;one of the best centres for folk art, music and dance in the country, and the annual Carnival is always a vibrant affair.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Besides the beaches, most sites of interest are located in or around the historic heart of the city. Despite restoration efforts many of the old churches and colonial buildings are in a state of sophisticated decay. Yet with its museums, cultural centres, public squares, bars and cafes oozing with music and folkloric interest, it remains a great place to explore.<br /><br />Just four miles away is the traditional town of Olinda. Its baroque churches, mansions, gardens and fine colonial architecture have earned it the status of a UNESCO World Heritage site.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br /><em>•</em> Marco Zero (dock-side monument to mark the founding of the city in 1537)<br />• Rua Bom Jesus (street settled by Jewish businesses during Dutch rule)<br />• Igreja da Ordem Terceira de São Francisco and Capela Dourada (baroque church and chapel)<br />• Pátio de São Pedro (square lined with historic buildings)<br />• Museu do Homem do Nordeste (museum of regional history)<br />• Boa Viajem beach</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The Gal&aacute;pagos consist of 13 large islands and six small, which were formed by oceanic volcanoes some three to five million years ago.<br />
<br />
Visitors come to the islands to see the unparalleled variety of wildlife that flourishes due to the remote location and temperate climate. The most famous residents are the giant tortoises after whom the islands are named, although other common species include iguana, dolphins, boobies and cormorants.</p>
<p>Straddling the Equator 1,000km (622 miles) off the coast of <strong><a href="/i/ecuador">Ecuador</a></strong>, the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands are famous for being the inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visiting the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands on a budget is difficult. Tourists pay a $100 entrance fee to the National Park authorities on arrival. Make sure you have cash when you land; cards are not accepted.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Visitors arriving at the Galapagos by cruise ship will realise just how remote these volcanic specks straddling the Equator in the Pacific Ocean are. It is this isolation which makes the islands so special. Around 50% of the islands' species are found nowhere else in the world.<br />
<br />
The Galapagos is an attraction in its own right and most people hop on a boat to view the marine wildlife or explore the volcanic landscape of this archipelago, the whole of which is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Most of the residents live in Puerto Ayora, which is the main access point for visitors to the Santa Cruz Island. Some of the other islands have small fishing villages.<br />

							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Cruise ships usually dock in Punta Arenas after its passengers have been blown away by the mountains, glaciers, inlets and islands of Chilean west coast.</p>
<p>In contrast, the city does not have the same spectacular scenery and is rather flat and orderly. But this does not mean it has little to offer the visitor - it has a rich and varied <strong>history</strong> thanks to its unique trading position in the southern Pacific Ocean. Plus it is a gateway to many of southern <a href="/i/chile">Chile</a>'s scenic wonders and wildlife havens.</p>
<p>Punta Arenas is one of the southernmost cities in the world, located at the toe of <strong>Chile</strong> in wild and exposed <strong>Patagonia</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>As a small city, it is possible to walk on foot to almost all points of interest. Many parts of the city are run down but its former glory is evident in the grand buildings and mansions erected during a period of wealth owing to the wool trade.<br />
<br />
Originally inhabited by local Indian tribes, Punta Arenas has been called home by a succession of European settlers over the last 150 years and this multicultural make-up is evident on the names on the headstones in the city's cemetery.<br />
<br />
Cruise ship visitors with more time to spare will be tempted by the natural attractions nearby. These include penguin colonies and a vast forest park with hiking and mountain bike trails.<br />

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Wool and leather goods and local handicrafts are the order of the day in Punta Arenas. Don't expect high-end fashion here. But there is a Zona Franca shopping centre (www.zonaustral.cl) full of tax-free imported goods, mainly consumer electronics such as cameras and computers, and outdoor gear.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>As long as you're not expecting a gourmet meal, you should be satisfied with the food here. There is plenty of choice in the city centre, including sandwich shops and restaurants serving home-cooked Chilean dishes.</p>]]></Restaurants>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It rises straight from the sea and its 42 hills are littered with multi-coloured houses, many of which have been converted into art galleries, museums and restaurants. Some of <a href="/i/chile">Chile</a>'s best-loved artists, writers and poets hail from the city and as a result <strong>Valpara&iacute;so</strong> boasts a buzzing arts scene.<br />
<br />
<strong>Valpara&iacute;so</strong> is dripping with <strong>history</strong> and the UNESCO World Heritage site has a timeless, slightly run down, quality about it. In contrast, nearby Vi&ntilde;a del Mar is Chile's smart and fashionable seaside resort with golden-sand beaches, shady boulevards and colonial mansions. Both destinations can be enjoyed during a short visit.</p>
<p><strong>Valpara&iacute;so</strong> is a thriving maritime city and Chile's main <strong>port</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Cruise ship visitors have direct access from the port into the labyrinth of alleyways and steep city streets. One of the best ways to appreciate the city is to ride in the funicular lifts which climb the hills. Each <em>mirador</em> (viewpoint) offers stunning views of the crystal waters of the bay and the snow-capped Andes in the background.<br />
<br />
The historic hill districts of <em>Concepci&oacute;n</em> and <em>Alegre</em> display strong Germanic and British influences from European traders. Here the steep, narrow, cobbled streets are crammed with colourful European-style houses, museums and churches. Valpara&iacute;so is also known for its lively bar scene and many of the buildings are illuminated at night. Vi&ntilde;a del Mar offers beach life, as well as museums and a botanical garden.<br />
<strong><br />
Highlights</strong><br />

								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>As Valpara&iacute;so is a port, there is a wide variety of seafood on offer, such as huge lobsters, abalone, prawns and giant <em>choros</em> (mussels). The city has a few fast food outlets and plenty of eateries selling Chilean dishes.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>It never gets too cold in this part of Chile, although October to April are the warmest, driest months. It can get very busy at the height of summer in December and January, when many people from <a href="/i/santiago">Santiago</a> take their holidays.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>This attractive town on the southernmost tip of <strong><a href="/i/argentina">Argentina</a></strong> sits on the shores of the Beagle Channel, which is the gateway to <strong><a href="/i/antarctica-0">Antarctica</a></strong>. Massive icebreaker ships jostle with luxury liners docked in the city's dramatic harbour surrounded by breathtaking mountain scenery of jagged icy peaks.<br />
<br />
Because of Ushuaia's remote location it has a fascinating local history, which can be discovered in the local museums, and a wealth of wildlife and natural landscapes to be explored in the surrounding mountains, beaches and islands.</p>
<p>Ushuaia really feels like it's at the end of the earth.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Sightseeing around Ushuaia is easy as most attractions are within walking distance, while those further afield are serviced by local tour operators. The Coastal Avenue is a promenade stretching the length of the city, passing sculptures and a must for visitors: having a photo taken by the End of the World sign.<br />
<br />
No visit to Ushuaia is complete without a trip to the Museo del Presidio, Ushuaia's ex-prison where wax models of the prison's most dangerous and infamous inmates sit in their cells. A boat trip on the Beagle Channel is a great way to get close to penguins, cormorants, seals and the various other flora and fauna of this chilly destination.<br />
<strong><br />
Highlights</strong><br />
&bull; Paseo Centenario (incredible panoramic views)<br />
&bull; The End of the World Museum<br />

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>As well as outdoor equipment stores and shops selling souvenirs and t-shirts, there are several places to pick up local handicrafts. In the Paseo de los Artesanos, local craftsmen make and sell items made of wood, silver, wool, leather and ceramics.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>As with all other places in Argentina, the local <em>parilla</em> (grill) is the centre point of all culinary experiences. Ushuaia has several of these 'steak houses' but there are also pizzerias and cafés selling global dishes and fine cakes and pastries.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Ushuaia has a chilly climate all year round but is pleasant in the spring and summer. The best time to visit is October to December, when temperatures are warmer and rainfall lower. Ushuaia becomes virtually impenetrable to the outside world in the winter.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

						<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Barren, rocky shores give way to sub-tropical forest and grassland on this remote island.<br /><br />Jamestown, the capital, nestles at the foot of a steep valley, and was a welcome port of call for sailing ships from the <strong>East India Company</strong> returning from their long ocean voyages in need of supplies and fresh fruit. Charles <a href="/i/darwin">Darwin</a> and Captain James Cook were among the illustrious visitors to the island. Today's friendly islanders are descendents of British settlers, slaves and indentured workers from Africa and the East.<br /><strong>St Helena</strong> island rises sharply from the South Atlantic Ocean, its steep, volcanic cliffs cut with deep valleys.</p>]]></Overview>
						<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The countryside is full of contrasts, from wind-eroded deserts to tree-covered hillsides and lush valleys. Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to St Helena for the last six years of his life, and his Longwood House residence in Jamestown is filled with Napoleonic memorabilia. The town has many fascinating buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries.<br /><br />The energetic can climb the 699 steps of Jacob's Ladder, or hike the steep hills hoping for a glimpse of the wirebird running through the long grass. Local taxis are a good way to tour the island and learn some of its fascinating history. Offshore wrecks offer excellent diving and snorkelling, but there are no good beaches for swimming. Join in a game of cricket or play 18 holes on one of the world's most remote golf courses. Deep sea game fishing can yield tuna, marline and barracuda.<br /><strong><br />Highlights </strong><br />• Jacob's Ladder<br />• Longwood House<br />• Plantation House<br />• Lot's Wife Ponds</p>]]></Sightseeing>

<br />
However, this small port is not without attractions of its own - it boasts mineral springs and special sands that have given it an international reputation as a centre of therapeutic tourism. It is also a major water sports and scuba diving destination, for cruise passengers eager to indulge in more active pursuits.<br />
<br />
Safaga's excellent beaches, its attractive islands and bay, and the small town surrounding the port are also a draw.<br />
Cruise ships call at Safaga, on <a href="/i/egypt">Egypt</a>'s Red Sea coast, for excursions to the many historic attractions of <strong>Luxor</strong>, around 220km (140 miles) inland.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>A day trip to Luxor is the main highlight of a cruise visit to Safaga. One of Egypt's major historic attractions, the former site of Thebes is renowned as the prime spot for exploring the legacy of the Pharaohs.<br />
<br />
The ancient temple complexes within the city itself, and the many other points of interest in the surrounding desert opposite the city on the west bank of the Nile, draw countless thousands of visitors, not least Howard Carter, who discovered the most famous tomb of all, that of Tutankhamun, in 1922.<br />

Saint Catherine's Monastery and Mount Sinai are other popular destinations, only a three-hour drive away.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It is also an important commercial and fishing port.<br /><br />Known for its fine beaches and busy tourist industry, it is also a major gateway to the inland attractions of the <strong>Sahara desert</strong>, and presents an interesting combination of old and new - longstanding Moroccan tradition and culture combining with modern facilities to offer a lively mix for the cruise passenger.<br /><br />Overall, though, Agadir is a modern city, with international influences having gained a major hold in the decades since the earthquake.<br />Rebuilt following a major earthquake in 1960, Agadir is a modern resort city and port firmly on the Atlantic cruise ship itinerary.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Superb beaches, wide palm-fringed boulevards, excellent resort hotels and self-catering accommodation, and all types of sports activities are the main features of Agadir. It has an excellent covered souk, which sells local specialities. The fish market is also worth visiting to see the locals at work. Day trips into the desert, and to the former earthquake refugee centre, now a town in its own right, are a popular option for cruises stopping here.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• The Old Kasbah<br />• La Musée des Arts Berbers (Berber Arts Museum)<br />• <a href="/i/marrakech">Marrakech</a> day tour<br />• Taroudant tour<br />• Beaches<br />• Inezgane</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>The co-operative shops of Moroccan craftsmen, <em>coopartim</em>, operate under state control selling local handicrafts at fixed prices. The souk (bazaar) is also a worthwhile place to visit for local products. Special buys are leather, copperware, silver, silk or cotton garments, wool rugs, carpets and blankets. Bargaining is essential and good buys generally work out at around a third of the asking price.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Agadir's international resort status means it offers a good range of European/international food, but it's worth trying local specialities like couscous, tajine (stews) and <em>djaja mahamara</em> (chicken stuffed with almonds, semolina and raisins).</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Agadir has a warm, Mediterranean climate tempered on the eastern coast by south-westerly trade winds.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Although a major industrial centre and port, Tangier's economy relies heavily on tourism, and cruise ships are an important source of visitors, who rapidly discover an intriguing mix of east and west in the narrow winding streets of the Medina (Old Town) and the attractive broad boulevards of the newer part of the city, with their art deco architecture.<br /><br />Tangier also has excellent beaches, and great opportunities for exploring further afield.<br />One of <strong><a href="/i/morocco">Morocco</a>'s</strong> oldest cities, Tangier dates back over 2,000 years and cruise visitors will soon find that it offers a rich heritage combining many cultures, together with thriving modern development.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Tangier is a very walkable city, not least in the Old Town, which is very well preserved and very much a 'living' part of the city, although many of the shops and stalls cater primarily to tourists. The Kasbah, as it is known, is without doubt the main draw in the city itself.<br /><br />Outside Tangier, day trip possibilities are varied - a major attraction being the Caves of Hercules, about 14 km (9 miles) west of the city, which offer not only great scenic appeal but archaeological interest too.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• The Kasbah<br />• Kasbah Museum<br />• Grand Socco market square and Mendoubia Gardens<br />• American Legation Museum<br />• Museum of Contemporary Art<br />• Tomb of Ibn Battuta</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>The souk in the Medina is a good stop for cruise ship passengers seeking clothing and souvenirs, while the Casa Barata (Cheap House) flea market can be good for bargains, but beware of fake goods.

								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Cheap eats and snacks are readily available in the Medina area, while more plush international establishments cluster on the seafront.

							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />The port itself has origins dating back nearly 4,000 years, and is the subject of numerous mentions in the Bible. Over the centuries, it has been home to numerous cultures, but the modern city sprang to life in the mid-1950s following the establishment of modern <strong><a href="/i/israel">Israel</a></strong>. It's an important industrial centre, but there is some cultural interest in the city itself.<br /><br />New terminal facilities make arrival here a pleasant experience for cruise passengers.<br />Cruise ships arriving at Israel's largest port offer their passengers the opportunity to visit either nearby <strong>Tel-Aviv</strong>, or the more popular <strong><a href="/i/jerusalem">Jerusalem</a></strong>, which lies just 70km (43 miles) inland from Ashdod.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Ashdod is ideally located for day trips to Jerusalem, one of the most revered cities on the planet for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Here, attractions range from religious buildings, emblems and archaeological relics, including the famous Wailing Wall.<br />The Dead Sea is also within reach of a day tour from Ashdod, for cruise passengers wishing to experience the supposedly therapeutic properties of the saline waters, as is Bethlehem, home of the Church of the Nativity.<br /><br />For a more modern experience, some may also choose to make the short trip to <a href="/i/tel-aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, a bustling centre of commerce, and good for shopping.<br /><strong><br />Highlights<br /></strong>The Ashdod Museum<br />Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem<br />Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem<br />Israel Museum, Jerusalem<br />Mount Zion<br />The Tomb of David<br />Yad Vashem, the holocaust memorial, Jerusalem</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Ashdod itself has a number of shopping malls, while in Jerusalem's Muslim Quarter the ubiquitous Arab souks provide an antidote to the modern shopping centres of West Jerusalem. In the city's Old Jewish Quarter, specialist shops offer jewellery, carpets and leather goods. Best buys include precious stones, glassware, wine, religious items and silverware. Bargaining is normal in the souks, but is not customary in Jewish shops.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>A wide range of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, European and Jewish food is available throughout Israel - the choice of restaurants and cafés is huge. Snacks and light meals range from German-style sausages to kebabs.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Israel enjoys a southern Mediterranean climate with a long, warm, dry summer, and generally mild winters. The coast can be humid in the warmest months, but in Jerusalem, in the hills, the air is more pleasant. Rainfall is relatively unusual.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>&quot;To Aqaba,&quot; cried Peter O'Toole in Sam Lean's epic film, <em>Lawrence of Arabia,</em> filmed in Jordan's Wadi Rum. Those immortal words are bound to ring in your ears as you float into this historic port. Of course, Lawrence and the mounted Bedouin tribes of the Arab Revolt would have approached the town across the desert rather than by sea and would therefore have missed the spectacular vista enjoyed by cruise ship passengers, of the becalmed Gulf of Aqaba, ringed by auburn desert mountains. Some of Aqaba's old history remains amid the elegant new resorts of <a href="/i/jordan">Jordan</a>'s beloved seaside town.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Aqaba is the only access by sea to Jordan - and what a sea it is!

Uniquely different, the town celebrates its mixed population of artists, hippies, gays, lesbians, rat-race drop-outs and fishermen. Natives call themselves 'conchs' (pronounced konks) after a Caribbean mollusk that lives in a big shell and goes at its own pace -- describing the community that calls itself the Conch Republic. Bars and boutiques cater to tourists, six-toed cats have their own veterinarian at Ernest Hemingway's former home, and roosters rule at the base of the town lighthouse.<br />Key West is a funky community at the southernmost tip of the continental U.</p>]]></Overview>

								<Content>
									<General>
										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Its days as a lumber, cattle and phosphate-shipping port have diminished, but Tampa is richly flavored by the migration in the late 19th century of Hispanics to the 200 cigar-rolling factories. Sports fans know Tampa as home to a professional football team, an ice hockey team that plays just blocks from the cruise terminal and a major league baseball franchise to the west, in St. Petersburg.<br />Tampa is the business hub of the Gulf Coast of <a href="/i/united-states-america/florida">Florida</a>, with emphasise on banking, real estate, insurance and shipping interests.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Next to the cruise terminal is the Florida Aquarium; here are otters, wading birds and more. For a fee you can don a wetsuit and swim with the sharks. The Ybor City entertainment district can be reached via electric tram or taxi from the ship; former cigar factories are artists' studios and shopping malls; a community museum offers walking tours. Canoe rentals are available along the Hillsborough River, which runs from forested park through the commercial downtown. <br /><br /><strong>Highlights:<br /></strong>• Ybor City<br />• Tampa Theatre (grandiose 1926 movie palace)<br />• Busch Gardens (wild animals, thrill rides)<br />• Lowry Park Zoo<br />• Florida Aquarium <br />• Henry B. Plant Museum<br />• Golf</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Hispanic cuisine is popular, especially in traditional restaurants in Ybor City. Main courses would include paella, which combines rice, saffron, chicken, seafood and Spanish sausage and pork dishes. But among Tampa's most-noted restaurants, the focus is on steaks - <a href="/i/bern">Bern</a>'s is considered the finest steakhouse in all of Florida - as well as Caribbean, seafood and Deep South, or soul food. The most popular saltwater fish are grouper, mackerel and mullet.

								<Content>
									<General>
										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The name may be familiar - it's taken from the island that is home to America's space-launch operations: Cape Canaveral. Before that multibillion-dollar effort was sited here half a century ago, Merritt Island - <a href="/i/united-states-america/florida">Florida</a>'s largest - and the peninsular Cape were home to seabirds, alligators and a handful of fishermen and retirees smart enough to settle in undeveloped Florida. Once the rocket-jockeys and scientists established this as a frontier to space, the two-lane roads sprouted motels, bars and stucco houses. Some of the natural beauty has been preserved in adjacent national parks.<br />Port Canaveral is the fancy name for the cruise docks on a barrier island on Florida's Atlantic coast.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Port Canaveral's cruise docks pose a bit of a challenge for passengers who want to do something onshore. The docks offer unbeatable views of the Space Shuttle when it launches or lands about 24km (15 miles) to the north, but there is little within walking distance of the ships. On the other hand, just a taxi ride away are two national parks and two other landmarks; after a tour bus ride of an hour or so, visitors arrive at the main attraction: the Walt Disney World theme parks in <a href="/i/orlando">Orlando</a>. <br /><br />Closest to the cruise piers is a unique piece of Florida lore: Cocoa Beach's Ron Jon Surf Shop, a multi-storey, DayGlo-coloured mix of commerce and history. What surfing is available in Florida tends to be in this area, and Ron Jon's long ago staked its claim as <em>the</em> surfers' shack. Slightly farther away is the excellent Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. For a fee, visitors may take bus tours past launch pads of the Mercury and Apollo space missions, walk past rockets and through the Mercury Mission Control Room. <br /><strong><br />Highlights:</strong><br />• Kennedy Space Center<br />• Canaveral National Seashore<br />• Ron Jon Surf Shop<br />• Theme parks in Orlando</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Content>
									<General>
										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Lauderdale (locals drop the 'Fort') is a smart Atlantic coast resort that's been a hit with vacationers for more than 50 years. <br /><br />Visitors from landlocked areas are drawn to its miles of fabulous <strong>white sand beaches</strong> -- and to ride water taxis and water buses along its 300 miles (482 kms) of canals. The city also boasts <strong>upscale shopping</strong>, <strong>top museums</strong> and <strong>trendy nightlife</strong>. Lauderdale seems the 'common man's' approachable answer to glitzy, bubbling-over <a href="/i/miami">Miami</a>, less than 30 crowded miles to the south.<br /><br />Port Everglades is the clever title for the commercial harbour serving attractive Fort Lauderdale even though the port is actually more than 20 miles (32 kms) from <a href="/i/united-states-america/florida">Florida</a>'s celebrated Everglades.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Lauderdale's county has more boats registered than any of Florida's 66 other counties - largely because the 300 miles (482 kms) of canals make it convenient for residents to commute to jobs, head for waterside entertainment districts, or venture into the Atlantic to fish or float. Visitors can enjoy the canals by stepping aboard the frequent water taxis or booking aboard a tour boat. <br /><br />Alternatively, visitors can take a land taxi to the edge of the Everglades and then roar over its waters on an airboat. This vast subtropical wilderness, a national wildlife preserve, is home to rare plants, birds and animals, including the endangered Florida panther, ospreys, manatees, black bear and saltwater crocodiles. There are several visitor centres that organise ranger-led walks and talks, tram tours and canoe trails.<br /><br /><strong>Highlights:</strong><br />• Everglades National Park<br />• Las Olas and Riverwalk shopping/entertainment promenades<br />• Canal network<br />• Museum of Art<br />• Museum of Discovery and Science<br />• Championship golf</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Sawgrass Mills Mall (the world's largest designer outlet mall) has more than 275 specialty shops and is located just outside of the city. Within the city centre, the Galleria shopping has America's high-end brand names, plus another 150 stores. The Swap Shop flea market (think an indoor boot sale without the cars) is said to be the largest in the <a href="/i/united-states-america">United States</a>.</p>]]></Shopping>
										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>The city has courted fine dining, so much so that some insiders call this 'Fork Lauderdale'. As throughout Florida, seafood is fresh and a menu staple; specialties include smoked mullet and meat from the huge claws of the stone crab. Other popular dishes originate from <a href="/i/cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="/i/jamaica">Jamaica</a> and South America.</p>]]></Restaurants>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Banana plantations, sugarcane crops, powder fine sands and mountain peaks characterize the scenery with the twin-mountains of the Pitons rising out of the sea. Another spectacle is the bubbling springs of the steam-shrouded Qualibou Volcano.<br /><br />Culturally speaking, <a href="/i/st-lucia">St Lucia</a>'s heritage mixes considerable British and French influences with the <a href="/i/caribbean">Caribbean</a>'s African roots and the island's aged Carib Indian traditions. This unique fusion of cultures is evident at every turn, from the neatly-painted<strong> </strong>colonial-style plantations and French-laden patois to St Lucia's easy-going Caribbean friendliness and hospitability. Castries' deep sea port, built in 1948, is used year-round by cruise liners.<strong> </strong>It contains duty free shops at Point Seraphine and La Place Carinage and is home to umpteen restaurants and dozens of harbour-side bars.<br />Renowned for its stunning volcanic terrain, lush rainforests, rolling meadows and pristine beaches, St Lucia is cooled by a refreshing trade wind - a blessing during the soaring summer highs.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>It has been hailed one of the most beautifully located Caribbean cities, and Castries certainly boasts an enviable spot. Edged by verdant, green hills on an expansive bay, the capital is alive with dawn-'til-dusk hustle and bustle. Boats, buses, cars and taxis ferry people to and fro as passengers disembark at Point Seraphine to delve in Castries - and beyond. <br /><strong><br />Highlights: </strong><br />• Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception<br />• Derek Walcott Square (named after the island's Nobel Prize-winning poet)<br />• Morne Fortune (Hill of Good Luck)<br />• Vigie Beach<br />• Malabar Beach<br />• Choc Beach<br />• La Toc Beach</p>]]></Sightseeing>

Other quality items include beaded jewellery, straw-woven hats, rugs, bags, sandals and wood carvings.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Seafood features on every St Lucia menu, from local <em>langouste</em> (lobster), <em>tatiri </em>(a small fish, deep-fried and eaten whole) and <em>lambi </em>(conch) to fried jackfish.

In the city, some fine boutiques specialise in amber-set silver jewellery, larimar (a Dominican turquoise) and inlaid creamy-blue and baby-pink shell. Pieces of conch shell are also made into jewellery. Other locally made must-buys include cigars, pottery,  coffee, rocking chairs, carved woods, macram&eacute;, Taino artefact replicas, Creole dolls, basketry, Haitian paintings and limestone carvings.

Luck is a commodity at <a href="/i/st-maarten">St Maarten</a>'s 13 casinos but chance plays no part in finding a good meal at the many world-class eateries. The isle's biggest asset is its friendly natives.<br />When the cruise ship pulls into this<strong> </strong>Caribbean port,<strong> </strong>passengers will get to visit two countries - <strong>Dutch St Maarten</strong> and <strong>French St Martin</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Cruise passengers don't need to wander far from port to stroll the boardwalk and shops of Philipsburg. Also nearby is the 12-Metre Challenge. Experience is not necessary to have a good time sailing crafts that once competed in the America's Cup Race.<br /><br />Or, relax on the beach. There is one to suit every taste but one of the most beautiful and happening shorelines is Orient Beach. Explore the island - it has so much to offer. Sample the gourmet cuisine in the charming village of Grand Case. Hire a taxi or car and discover the island. Be forewarned that the roads aren't the greatest and traffic can be a nightmare.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• Casinos<br />• Le Fort St Louis<br />• Pic du Paradis<br />• Plantation Mont Vernon<br />• Loterie Farm<br />• Butterfly Farm</p>]]></Sightseeing>

Otrabanda's Kurá Hulanda Museum sits on an 18th-century courtyard, a former slave market.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Although situated in the Atlantic Ocean, the <a href="/i/bahamas">Bahamas</a> are typically considered part of the <a href="/i/caribbean">Caribbean</a>. And it's clear why with turquoise waters surrounding white sand beaches similar to the 'tropics'. <br /><br />Residents speak in a lilting British accent and tend to function on 'island time', a catch-all describing the laid-back, 'no problem' demeanor. Island history ranges from Columbus landing here as he 'discovered' the New World, pirates, the slave trade, and the British Empire's forward posts, such as Fort Charlotte, built in 1788.<br />Most cruise passengers sailing into the Bahamas are only familiar with the busy capital of Nassau, however, the archipelago actually consists of around 700 islands, with fewer than 40 of them actually inhabited.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Nassau is either about relaxation or shopping. If you want to switch sunbathing from the ship's lido deck to the sand, take a taxi to four-mile-long <a href="/i/bahamas/cable-beach">Cable Beach</a>. To get a feel for the city, step aboard a horse-drawn surrey just beyond the ship's wharf, in Rawson's Square. Also in the Square are pitchmen for diving, fishing and boating excursions - who tend to emphasize the rum-soaked nature of their voyages. <br /><br />Within walking distance from the wharf are also museums, examples of 18th and 19th century British Colonial architecture and, of course, the shopping. It begins at the bustling 'straw market', where some locals create straw goods and carve wood on the spot. Most passengers have been briefed aboard ship about the duty-free stores on Bay Street, bordering Rawson Square. <br /><br />On neighboring Paradise Island is the extravagant resort Atlantis, which conducts property tours (for a fee) and also sells admission to its 34-acre water park, full of slides, waterfalls and breathtaking underwater walkways through the world's largest outdoor aquarium.<br /><strong><br />Highlights:</strong><br />• Straw Market<br />• Bay Street<br />• Pompey Museum, on the slave trade<br />• Ardastra Gardens, with flamingos, parrots, monkeys and jaguars<br />• The Queen's Staircase, a 102-foot climb up limestone steps<br />• Forts Charlotte and Fincastle<br />• Atlantis</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Prices on Bay Street tend to be standard from store to store, but careful shoppers can find bargains on jewelry, watches, cameras, liquor, china, glass and silver. Finer local products include seashell jewellery and woodcarvings.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>There is a wide choice of restaurants and bars. Specialities include conch (pronounced konk, this snail-like mollusk is served steamed, grilled, broiled, in chowders and as fried fritters), grouper, crab and red snapper. Fruit includes pineapple, mango, breadfruit and papaya. Local drinks are all about rum; the island beer is Kalik.</p>]]></Restaurants>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br /><a href="/i/jamaica">Jamaica</a>'s Ocho Rios is known as the 'garden parish' thanks to its lush tropical flora and<strong> </strong>exotic fauna, magnificent waterfalls and winding rivers. The coastal island town also boasts one of Jamaica's most popular attractions, <strong>Dunn's River Falls</strong>.<br /><br />Like all Jamaican towns, Ocho Rios is alive with <strong>reggae music</strong> and tourists who meander along the beaches and through the open-air restaurants and markets. Movie buffs know that '<strong>Goldeneye</strong>', the luxurious former estate of James Bond author Ian Fleming, is just a few miles east of town. It's been converted into a high-end resort.<br />Cruise ships dock in downtown <strong>Ocho Rios</strong> and you can easily walk straight into the town's craft markets, restaurants and bars.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The rivers and waterfalls in and around Ocho Rios make for top kayaking, hiking and exploring. Dunn's River Falls' 183m (600ft) waterfall is a must-see. You can swim near the pounding falls and, if you dare, hike up the slippery rocks. A quieter alternative is the nearby YS Falls. Horseback rides are offered along the beach or through the historic, 600-acre Annandale Plantation. Golfers can tee off 213m (700ft) above sea level at Sandals Golf & Country Club. A drive through Fern Gully (on Route A3),<strong> </strong>a natural canopy of vegetation, lets you glimpse hundreds of different fern species.<br /><br />Kids can tube, bungee jump or bounce on a water trampoline at the small beach near Island Village market. The most memorable and educational experience might be the Jamaica Tourist Board's 'Meet the People' programme, which lets you visit a local school or spend a day with Jamaican families. Arrangements must be made in advance.<br /><strong><br />Highlights<br /></strong>• Dunn's River Falls<br />• River rafting on White River or Black River<br />• Swimming with dolphins at Dolphin Cove<br />• Bike riding through the Blue Mountains<br />• Turtle Beach<br />• Reggae Vibes Beach<br />• James Bond Beach</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Cruise passengers disembark directly into Ocho Rios's craft markets and duty-free shopping areas. There are several malls to choose from, but Island Village, an open-air market<strong>,</strong> sells Jamaican handicrafts and duty-free items. Unique terracotta items are sold at Wassi Art Pottery Works and people drive a few minutes outside of town to purchase hand-carved wooden boxes made by Annabella Proudlock. The locally made Blue Mountain coffee is a popular souvenir. Other souvenirs include Jamaican rum, like the sweet <em>rumona</em> liqueur (the world's only rum-based liqueur, hard to find outside the island) or Tia Maria Blue Mountain coffee.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Jerk flavouring - Scotch bonnet peppers plus other herbs and spices - was created in Jamaica and is a must-try with meat or fish. Another culinary option is <em>i-tal</em> (Rastafarian vegetarian dishes).</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Consistently warm weather makes Jamaica a year-round destination. The temperatures in the mountains tends to be a little cooler but also more humid.

						<Content>
							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Its population is largely descended from African slaves brought here to work sugar cane fields. Pirates loved <a href="/i/jamaica">Jamaica</a>'s protected anchorages. But the Royal Navy ultimately did away with buccaneers, and in the 20th century, tourism and mining surpassed sugar, rum and coffee production in the economy. But even a visitor is likely to notice Jamaica is an island of haves and have-nots.<br />Lush, green and hilly, Jamaica is the third-largest <a href="/i/caribbean">Caribbean</a> island, after <a href="/i/cuba">Cuba</a> and Hispaniola.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>First, call it by the commonly used 'Mo Bay'. On the northwestern edge of Jamaica, Mo Bay is a vacation destination, with hotels and resorts catering especially to Americans. Decades before they arrived, Ian Fleming chose Montego Bay for his holiday home, and here he wrote his early James Bond novels. He put Bond at Doctor's Cave, one of the acclaimed local white sand beaches. Most famous - or infamous - of the remaining sugar plantation great houses is the18th-century Rose Hall. This was the home of Annie Palmer, called the White Witch of Rose Hall because she practiced voodoo, frightening her 2,000 slaves. <br /><br />Also open for tours is Greenwood Great House. Greenwood has no ghost stories but does have a pub. Other tourist activities include visiting the Appleton Rum Estate, golfing on championship courses and river rafting.<br /><strong><br />Highlights </strong><br />• Golfing<br />• Doctor's Cave beach<br />• Greenwood and Rose Hall great houses<br />• Montego Bay Marine Park (for scuba diving)<br />• Martha Brae River rafting</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Duty-free shops feature crystal, leather goods, perfumes and gold pieces. Half Moon Village is the prime destination for high-end buyers, whereas haggling is common in the craft market on Market Street. The best Jamaican products are carved wood and batik fabric. Lowest prices on Blue Mountain and High Mountain coffee and rum are in the supermarkets; tourist stores inflate prices.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>There is a variety of restaurants in Montego Bay, but you're here, so eat as the Jamaicans do. The main course will likely be the barbecue called <em>jerk</em>. Generally your jerk pork has been basted with peppers, allspice and other herbs and cooked over a coal fire. You can also find jerk chicken and goat. Seafood is widely available, especially salt fish (usually dried cod) and <em>ackee </em>(the cooked fruit of the ackee tree). Another staple is rice and peas (actually kidney beans mixed with white rice, coconut milk and scallions).</p>]]></Restaurants>

								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Port Antonio offers many historical sights, including<em> </em>Folly Ruins, the remnants of a majestic, early 20th-century mansion, Fort George (which has its cannons pointing out to sea), Trident Castle and<em> </em>Bonnie View hotel, all of which boast interesting architecture and fascinating stories.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Located in Trelawney parish in northern <a href="/i/jamaica">Jamaica</a>, Falmouth is the country&rsquo;s newest yet one of its most historic cruise destinations. Falmouth offers travellers a glimpse into everyday Jamaican life and its colonial past with its impressive 19th-century Jamaican Georgian architecture and intricate &lsquo;gingerbread&rsquo; woodwork. <br />
<br />
An eclectic mix of cultures contributes to Falmouth&rsquo;s vibrant atmosphere. Tourists can stroll along Falmouth Historic District then weave through open-air markets before grabbing a bite to eat or some drinks at a tavern playing Jamaica&rsquo;s omnipresent reggae music. <br />
&nbsp;</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>After a walk around the historic town, guests can meander through the Martha Brae gardens before gently drifting down the scenic Martha Brae River on a 9m (30 ft) bamboo raft guided by an expert.</p>
<p>For an unforgettable sight, head to the Luminous Lagoon, where the water flowing down the Martha Brae River converges with the salty water of the Caribbean Sea. The waters here glow a luminous green due to the presence of rare, freshwater microbes. Travellers can swim in the lagoon&rsquo;s shallower areas and bask in its unique ambience.</p>
<p>Falmouth is flanked by two popular resorts, <a href="/i/montego-bay">Montego Bay</a> and <a href="/i/ocho-rios">Ocho Rios</a>, and excursions to beautiful white-sand beaches in the surrounding areas are popular. For those looking for something a little more daring, the famed 183m-high (600ft) high Dunn's River Falls, just 45-minutes by car from Falmouth, allows adventure seekers to climb up slippery rocks or to take the plunge with a refreshing swim in the pounding water. </p>]]></Sightseeing>
								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Falmouth&rsquo;s new dock may have got off to a bumpy start after a number of delays in its construction, but it boasts a truly unique experience that is distinct from neighbouring destinations Ocho Rios and Montego Bay.</p>
<p>Passengers disembark directly into the heart of Falmouth, where the streets are scattered with Georgian buildings and character-filled churches. From here, visitors can embark on heritage walking tours, browse local shopping areas and explore the town&rsquo;s squares and historic houses. Falmouth was the first town in Jamaica to have running water, with a reservoir in Water Square, which is today a popular commercial area of the town.<br />
&nbsp;</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Mouth-tingling Jerk flavours dominate the local cuisine with distinct recipes using everything from shrimp and lobster to chicken and pork. Top off your culinary adventure with refreshing local fruits such as akee or star apples. </p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>A year-round tropical climate makes Jamaica a favoured cruise destination. Afternoons may be hot and humid at sea level, but higher inland regions have a more temperate, cooler climate. Jamaica's dry season runs from December to April and this is a good time to visit, but the summer months offer the best rates for holiday visitors.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Today, many cruise<strong> </strong>passengers<strong> </strong>believe that<strong> </strong>booty still abounds in Charlotte Amalie's bustling duty-free shops. Besides being one of the Caribbean's top shopping meccas, the island sports an interesting history and another treasure, its friendly natives.<br /><br />When ships pull into port, holidaymakers are awed by the island's undulating landscape and silky, sand <strong>beaches</strong>. From terra firma, they view stunning panoramas and clear, crystal seascapes. Its watery boundaries are very popular with divers, snorkellers, fisherman and yachties.<br />The <strong><a href="/i/us-virgin-islands">US Virgin Islands</a></strong> was once a top-notch lusting and looting destination for pirates and a place to conceal treasure.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Beyond St Thomas's shops and vendors is one of the Caribbean's<strong> </strong>most interesting islands. Learn about its history at Emancipation Gardens (a memorial to freed slaves), the 17th-century Fort Christian which houses the Virgin Islands Museum, and climb 99 Steps up to Government Hill (really 103 steps but the Danes who laid out this hilly island miscalculated). Leave the city's bustle and spend time on the beach or enjoy some watersports.<strong><br /><br />Highlights<br /></strong>• Bluebeard's Tower, the 19th-century pirate's one-time abode<br />• St. Croix<br />• St. John<br />• Coral World Ocean Park<br />• Paradise Point Tramway<br />• Mountain Top / St. Peter's Greathouse</p>]]></Sightseeing>

For local handicrafts such as carved calabash bowls, shell jewellery, West Indian dolls and straw brooms, try the Caribbean Marketplace in Havensight Mall. Many shops are near the cruise ship dock.</p>]]></Shopping>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>A land of verdant, undulating landscape and roaring waterfalls, its beaches ebb, flow and disappear with the whim of the sea. Roads do the same in the<strong> </strong>wilderness. Per capita, the 47km (16-mile) wide, 26km (32-mile) long isle has more national <strong>marine preserves</strong>, parks and <strong>forests</strong> than any other place on the planet. There are also over 360 pristine rivers - one for every day of the year.<br /><br />Cruise ships dock at its capital, <strong>Roseau</strong>. Allow about an hour - two if you like to take your time - to cruise its markets, shops and museum. The port<strong> </strong>city is the starting point for many off-land adventures like <strong>whale watching</strong>. A top diving destination, its waters are awash with creatures and vertical drops ranging from 240-460m (800-1,500ft). Take time to explore the island's inland wonders too.<br />Wedged between the <strong><a href="/i/caribbean">Caribbean</a> </strong>islands of <a href="/i/martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="/i/guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, <strong><a href="/i/dominica">Dominica</a></strong> is the region's only natural <strong>UNESCO World Heritage site</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Forget the glitz and casinos of other ports. Dominica is strictly an outdoor destination. Powder-like black, brown or white sand blankets its windswept beaches, betraying its tumultuous volcanic past. Often these desolate shorelines are more conducive to chilling out than swimming since strong undercurrents and large frothy waves border them. But Champagne Beach on the west coast is a perfect swimming and snorkelling destination. Volcanic vents puff bubbles into the sea making it feel as if you are swimming in a flute of bubbly.<br /><br />In the interior, hiking trails slither up mountain paths and you're never far from a waterfall. The Rainforest Aerial Tram inches through the rainforest then ascends 90m (300ft) over mountain greenery. A nature trail near the top crosses Breakfast River Gorge on a suspension bridge and reveals a breathtaking panorama.<br /><br />Be aware that sites are often isolated and difficult to find. There are no real street signs and the winding roads are narrow. To make better use of your port time, hire a driver or join an organised excursion.<br /><strong><br />Highlights </strong><br />• Champagne Beach<br />• Emerald Pool, a beautiful rainforest grotto complete with waterfall<br />• Boat rides up the mangrove-lined Indian River<br />• Kalinago Barana Autê (Kalinago cultural village)<br />• Morne Trois Pitons National Park<br />• Scotts Head Soufriére Marine Reserve</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>A variety of duty-free shops are located on the Bayfront, close to where the cruise ships pull into port. Browse and haggle at the open-air booths at the Old Market Place. This former slave market, which is your best bet for handcrafted jewellery, T-shirts, spices, souvenirs, batik, plus lacquered and woven bamboo boxes, is located behind the museum. Kalinago Barana Autê also has a fine selection of local crafts and baskets.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Since the island's economy is dependent on agriculture, there is an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables. Seafood and spicy Creole creations, often accompanied by plantains, are specialities. Chicken is prepared any number of ways. Locals enjoy <em>manicou </em>(small possum) and <em>agouti</em> (large rodent) but those dishes are not for the weak of stomach. The local drink is <em>nanny, </em>a spiced rum. There are only a few high-end restaurants. Many eateries are within walking distance of the cruise ship.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>The weather is pretty much the same throughout the year - hot and often humid. In the mountains, which run down the island's spine, the weather is cooler. Avoid the island and most of the Caribbean during hurricane season - late May until early November. Even without a storm, the weather is muggy and rainy.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>First discovered by Juan de Bermudez, a Spanish sailor, in 1505 and named for him, the island chain was claimed in <a href="/i/united-kingdom/england">England</a>'s name in July 1609. After colonisation, the island prospered, with the tourist industry beginning in Victorian times. That is still the nation's economic base, and its continuing British cultural influences make it a popular destination for North Americans and Britons. The lure for vacationers is the moderate climate much of the year, many attractive small bays with beaches of pale pink sand and blue-green waters. Inland is an abundance of subtropical plants and flowers.<br /><a href="/i/bermuda">Bermuda</a> is a chain of about 180 coral islands that poke up slightly above the Atlantic in roughly the shape of a fish hook.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Beginning in the 1870s, ships regularly disembarked passengers in Hamilton, the crown colony's capital city. It is on the bay known as Great Sound, on the inner curve of Bermuda's 'fish hook'. But to reduce pedestrian crowds, most vessels now call at the cruise terminal at the former Royal Naval Dockyard, at the tip of the 'fish hook'. Here are military features dating back more than 200 years, a Maritime Museum and Bermuda Dolphin Aquarium. Ferries make the 15-minute trip across Great Sound into the commercial and government bustle of Hamilton. At the opposite end of the island, via bus, taxi or rental moped, is the touristy town of St George, with colonial-era<strong> </strong>facades, a popular town crier and even city stocks for souvenir photos.<br /><strong><br />Highlights <br /></strong>• Dolphin Aquarium<br />• Maritime Museum<br />• Natural History Museum and Zoo<br />• Bermuda Perfumery<br />• St George<br />• Botanical Gardens<br />• Golf</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't have as much glitz as many of the other islands. When cruise ships pull into<strong> </strong>port, the view is of lush, undulating landscape, colourful homes dotting its hillsides and crystal waters.<br /><br />Beaches arch around bays and coves. Some are secluded, while others are lined with bars and watersport outfitters. Surfers prefer Apple Bay Beach. Restaurants and bars line the North Shore's funky Cane Garden Bay, which is said to be the inspiration for Jimmy Buffett's 'cheeseburger in paradise'.<br />Tortola is a welcome relief from the bustling Caribbean<strong> </strong>Islands.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Tortola and the <a href="/i/british-virgin-islands">British Virgin Islands</a> are about nature. After exploring Tortola, leave enough time to explore some of the nearby isles like Jost Van Dyke. Because of its many fun bars, the island just to the northwest is known as the 'party island'.<br /><br />Virgin Gorda to the northeast is home to 'the Baths,' a labyrinth of granite boulders oddly protruding from the shore and water. And legend has it that the caves around Norman Island (south of Tortola) were once filled with pirate treasure. In fact, Robert Louis Stevenson patterned his famous "Treasure Island" after it. The booty is gone and, except for a beach bar, so are the humans. The once cache-filled coves now teem with schools of fish.<br /><strong><br />Highlights </strong><br />• Fort Burt<br />• JR O'Neal Botanic Gardens<br />• Old Government House Museum<br />• Peter Island<br />• Sage Mountain National Park<br />• Skyworld</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>A large sheltered port forms the heart of the city, allowing Pointe-à-Pitre to become <a href="/i/guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>'s largest city and economic hub. A leafy plaza - the <em>Place de la Victoire</em> - is shaded by palm trees and poincianas and hemmed by a sprawling market that leads to the docks. Although lacking in Old World colonial character, the city is a bustle of activity with a riddle of narrow streets to explore. Guadeloupe's main seaside resort, Le Gosier, is located in a nearby suburb. <br /><br /><br />Guadeloupe's commercial capital Pointe-à-Pitre sits on a limestone plateau in a strategic point on the isle of Grande Terre near the Rivière Salée ('Salt River') at the junction with Basse-Terre Island.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The island's lush swathes of rainforest offer some excellent walking trails and picnic areas for those keen to find an alternative to lying on the beach. Excursions out to Basse-Terre provide an opportunity to stroll around a fine old French colonial town, situated at the foot of the dormant volcano of La Soufrière. Bareboat charter or skippered cruises set sail each day to explore the archipelago of Guadeloupe with snorkelling boats and fishing captains in good supply around the dock.<br /><strong><br />Highlights:</strong><br />• Pavillion d'Exposition de Bergevin<br />• Centre Cultural Rémy Nainsouta<br />• Fort Fleur de L'Epée<br />• Sainte Marie de Capesterre, where Columbus landed<br />• Trois Rivières<br />• National Park of Guadeloupe, near St Claude, the base of La Soufrière, a dormant volcano<br />• St Charles Fort, built in 1605 and now restored and converted into a museum</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>From the dock, the market sprawls into town in a ramshackle collection of stalls and vendors. Choose from local handicrafts and goods, such as rum, straw goods, bamboo hats, Creole dolls and palm-woven baskets. Several stalls also offer a fine collection of colourful Creole jewellery. French imports are everywhere, be it boutiques, supermarket or a local store with wines and liqueurs surprisingly good value.</p>]]></Shopping>
										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Seafood appears on every menu in town, cooked in French, Creole, African or South East Asian styles. Choose from shrimp, lobster, turtle, red snapper, conch and sea urchin - generally served with plantain and rice. Stewed conch and stuffed crab are island specialities together with slow-cooked curried goat and rabbit. The local tipple, a potent brew of rum, lime, bitter and syrup called 'Punch', is best approached with caution. While local rum, beer and French brandy are most often drunk you'll find a good supply of <a href="/i/bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> wines, champagne and liqueurs.</p>]]></Restaurants>
										<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Year-round warm tropical heat is the norm, bringing steady highs of around 32°C (89°F) that drop to 20°C (68°F) at night. Brief downpours can occur at any time, but are most common during the rainy season June to October.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Before then, the Arawak and Carib Indians had called their homeland <em>Madinina</em> (meaning 'island of flowers') in honour of its vibrant varicoloured blooms. Today this east <a href="/i/caribbean">Caribbean</a> isle is marvelled at by tourists, drawn to the island by its volcanic landscape and natural splendour. Rolling sugar, palm, banana and pineapple plantations tumble down to fine white, black, or peppered sand beaches. <a href="/i/martinique">Martinique</a>'s location also makes it a stopping-off point for cruise ships, which dock at the capital's Pointe Simon. The island's French and Creole heritage is especially pronounced in bustling Fort-de-France, where Parisian chic is fused with a laid back Caribbean vibe. Shops stock French brands and bistros play Gallic folk music while Martiniquais clad head to toe Chanel tap their manicured toes to the lively sounds of local <em>zouk</em>.<br />Christopher Columbus declared Martinique 'the most beautiful country in the world' when he discovered it in 1493.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Be prepared to delve into Fort-de-France's narrow, winding streets to discover the capital's most colourful markets. In the centre of town, stroll through the park under the gaze of Napoleon's Empress Josephine, a native of Martinique. For the best bathing beaches head to<strong> </strong>Ste Anne, Le Diamant and<strong> </strong>Les Anses d'Arlets - the water is warm, calm and beautifully clear.<br /><strong><br />Highlights:</strong><br />• La Pagerie<br />• Parc des Floralies<br />• Musée Départemental<br />• Cathedral of St-Louis<br />• Montagne Pelée<br />• Musée Volcanologique<br />• Restored plantation of Leyritz<br />• Centre d'Art Paul Gauguin<br />• Pointe du Bout, Martinique's major resort area<br />• HMS Diamond Rock<br />• Fonds Saint-Jacques<br />• Maison de la Canne, a modern museum devoted to sugar and rum just outside Trois-îlets</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Local food is characterised by French and Caribbean influences, using fresh island produce and European panache.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The city is spread over three main locations: Fort Cochin (Kochi) on a promontory to the west, Willingdon Island and Ernakulam across the causeway. <br /><br />The city was first colonised by the Portuguese in the 15th century and still shows a strong <strong>Portuguese</strong> influence. There are several old churches that may be visited along with mosques, temples and even a synagogue. For visitors, Cochin is one of the easiest-going destinations in <a href="/i/india">India</a> and lacks much of the hustle and poverty found elsewhere in the country.<br /><strong>Cochin</strong>, with its strategic location on the <strong>Kerala</strong> coast, is historically southern India's most important <strong>port</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>No visit to Cochin is complete without a trip to the 16th-century Mattancherry Palace which was built by the Portuguese and given to the Raja of Kochi before eventually being taken over by the Dutch. The nearby Jew Town district with its synagogue, narrow streets, antique shops and spice auction houses is another rewarding place to wander. Visitors should also stroll along Fort Cochin's magnificent beach to see the traditional Chinese fishing nets scattered along the waterfront.<br /><strong><br />Highlights<br /></strong>• Mangalavanam<em> </em>bird sanctuary<br />• Ruins of Fort Cochin, built by the Portuguese in 1510AD<br />• Museum of Kerala History<br />• Hill Palace Museum<br />• St Francis Church, Port Cochin<br />• Santa Cruz Basilica Cathedral<br />• Willingdon and Bolghatty Islands<br />• Kathakali dance performances</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It has undergone a sustained period of change since handover to <a href="/i/china">China</a> in 1997, but has retained its exotic and glamorous appeal as a port of call on cruises in southeast <a href="/i/asia">Asia</a>.<br /><br /><strong><a href="/i/china/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a></strong> has also become far more Chinese than ever before, with many expats departed and a Beijing-facing government presiding over the former British colony.<br /><br />Hong Kong Island itself, with its glistening array of <strong>skyscrapers</strong> clustered around the spectacular harbour, is the core of the old imperial possession, with <strong>Kowloon</strong> just across the harbour forming the other half of the main conurbation.<br /><br />Further north are the <strong>New</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Territories</strong><strong>,</strong> leased from China in 1898, which form a slightly more rural hinterland. And around this main focus are the large islands of <strong>Lamma</strong> and <strong>Lantau</strong> and the smaller, quieter, Outlying Islands that complete the patchwork.<br />Bustling, glitzy and brash, Hong Kong has long been a <strong>major cruise destination</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong is one of the most riveting and unexpectedly beautiful spectacles on earth. The harbour view reflects the architectural boom of the 1980s and 1990s;a mixture of Manhattan and <a href="/i/san-francisco">San Francisco</a>, with added shipping bustle.<br /><br />At night it just gets better; the view from the Peak of Hong Kong's glittering lights is unforgettable; almost as dazzling are the towers of Central seen from the lovers' walk of Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. This tax-free, bustling port and commercial centre has many attractions worth visiting.<br /><strong><br />Highlights <br /></strong>• Ocean Park<br />• Miu Fat Monastery<br />• Fishing villages such as <a href="/i/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a><br />• Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island <br />• Night markets<br />• Victoria Peak (The Peak)<br />• Hong Kong Museum of History<br />• Ngong Ping 360 cable car<br />• Disneyland Hong Kong</p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong is the home of authentic Chinese food from all the regions of China, which may be sampled as snacks from the many streetside stalls, or in a vast range of restaurants of all levels - eating is very much part of the Southeast Asian culture.

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Home to just 2,500 permanent inhabitants, Honningsvåg is primarily a fishing community, characterised by brightly painted wooden buildings, but the summer months draw cruise ships aplenty, and the local population grows by 500 to help cater for these.<br /><br />It is further from Norwegian capital <a href="/i/oslo">Oslo</a> than it is from the North Pole itself, which lies a little over 2,100km (1304 miles) away. <br />Situated in the far north of <a href="/i/norway">Norway</a>, pretty little Honningsvåg is the gateway port for cruise passengers visiting the almost legendary Nordkapp (North Cape), second most northerly point in <a href="/i/europe">Europe</a>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Honningsvåg is the most northerly point in Europe and the gateway to the famous North Cape. It is surrounded by breathtaking fjords and waterfalls, and areas of dense forest, all bathed in the mysterious summertime light of the Midnight Sun.<br /><br />The North Cape's Midnight Sun is rightly famous - the sun never rises in winter, nor sets in midsummer. From Honningsvag, the North Cape is just 34km (21 miles) away.<br /><br /><strong>Highlights</strong><br />• Fjords and waterfalls<br />• Duken Mountain<br />• North Cape Visitor Centre<br />• North Cape Museum</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Silversmiths and potteries are numerous and worth visiting. Traditional items include furs, printed textiles, woven articles, knitwear, woodcarving, silver, enamel, pewter, glass and porcelain. Tax-free cheques can be obtained from any of the shops carrying the sticker 'Tax free for tourists'. These shops save visitors 11-18% of the price paid by residents. Refunds are paid on return to the cruise ship.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Honningsv&aring;g is small, but in summer there are cafes, shops, and hotel restaurants offering various fare including the superb seafood, and for those in search of a light snack, <em>koldtbord</em> (cold table buffet) or <em>p&oslash;lser</em> (sausages).</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Without doubt, the summer months are the best time to visit, due to the Midnight Sun (it's conversely permanently dark in winter). It can be chilly, though, even in July and August, so go prepared with waterproofs and warm clothing.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

						<Content>
							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Cruise ships arrive at the island's capital, Longyearbyen, which is also the Norwegian administrative centre on Svalbard (there is also a large Russian mining community on the islands).<br /><br />Sparsely populated Spitsbergen's name translates as 'Jagged Peaks', and the island is a true wilderness, home to polar bears and other Arctic wildlife. There are no roads, so at many times of year sleds, boats and snowmobiles are the only means of transport around this glaciated land.<br />Remote, wild and mysterious, Spitsbergen is the largest island on the Svalbard Archipelago, far above the Arctic Circle and a wonderful destination for the more adventurous cruise passenger.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The settlements of Spitsbergen are small and scattered meaning that traditional tourist attractions are few and far between.<br /><br />However, the Svalbard Museum, located at Svalbardporten (Gateway to Svalbard) in Longyearbyen, is as good a place to start as any. It gives an insight into the history of the islands since their discovery four centuries ago, along with a background to the islands' flora and fauna, mining and geology, and its whaling industry.<br /><br /><strong>Highlights</strong><br />• Glacier trekking<br />• Wildlife watching tours<br />• Horse riding<br />• Dog-sledding<br />• Boat trips</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>Shops are primarily located in the centre of Longyearbyen itself. There are several silversmiths and goldsmiths, and potteries are also worth visiting. Top buys include printed textiles, knitwear, woodcarvings, silver, gold, enamel, pewter, glass and porcelain. VAT, known as MOMS, is levied at 25% on most goods.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Longyearbyen offers several bars, cafés and restaurants, many of them located in local hotels. Specialities include open sandwiches, fresh fish and seafood, reindeer meat and other Arctic specialities, including the distinctive sweet Norwegian cheese, <em>brunost</em>.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Spitsbergen lies halfway between the northernmost tip of <a href="/i/norway">Norway</a> and the North Pole - and its climate reflects this. It can be cold any time of year, and snow is frequent and heavy. Stout footwear and windproof clothing are necessary all year.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

A popular package holiday destination, long stretches of the east coast are now lined with big resort hotels, but if you head for the west coast you can still find some dramatically beautiful unspoilt beaches.<br /><br />Cruise ships dock in the <strong>New Port</strong> and offer shuttle buses to Corfu Town, which is a 30-minute walk along the seafront.<br />On the east coast of Corfu, facing <a href="/i/albania">Albania</a>, elegant Corfu Town offers a fascinating mix of Greek, Italian, French and British architecture, and has been proclaimed a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage site</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Corfu's pedestrian-only old town is a warren of crumbling Venetian-style buildings, Italianate churches, chic boutiques and rustic tavernas. Locals gather on the Spianada, a vast green space where they play cricket, and the Liston, a 19th-century arcade sheltering a string of cafes. Guarding the town and accessed from the Spianada, the Old Fortress juts out into the sea, while the New Fortress commands a hilltop position behind the old town.<br /><br />Cruise companies offer several out-of-town excursions including the tiny church-capped islet of Pontikonissi, the late-19th-century neo-classical Achillion Palace in Gastouri, and Paleokastritsa, a village on the west coast with a hillside monastery and three sandy coves for bathing.<br /><strong><br />Highlights <br /></strong>• Spianada<br />• Liston<br />• Old Fortress (Byzantine)<br />• New Fortress (Venetian)<br />• Archaeological Museum (displaying ancient Greek stone carvings)<br />• Museum of Asiatic Art (displaying Chinese porcelains and Japanese watercolours)<br />• Byzantine Museum (displaying religious icons)<br />• Church of St Spyridon</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>There's not that much in the way of high-brow culture here, but visitors can easily spend several hours exploring Mykonos Town.

						<Content>
							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>On its northern tip, the capital, Rhodes Town, lies within impressive medieval fortifications built by the Knights of St John, a military religious order who made it their power base from 1309 to 1522. It was taken by the Ottoman Turks in 1522, hence the proud minarets that punctuate its skyline. Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, its cobbled streets are crammed with boutique hotels, rustic tavernas and souvenir shops.</p>
<p>Cruise ships dock in the Commercial Port, just a 5-minute walk from the old town. The green, fertile island of Rhodes is one of the most developed tourist destinations in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In June 2011, a new state-of-the-art marina will open, to the east of Rhodes Town, featuring shops, cafes, restaurants, a spa and a landscaped promenade, as well as glittering yachts.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>It's a joy to wander through the pedestrian-only, cobbled streets of Rhodes Town's old town, protected by 14th-century fortifications measuring 4km (2.5 miles) in length. The top attraction is the vast 14th-century Palace of the Grand Masters, housing a museum tracing the island's history. To reach it, walk up Ippoton Street, lined with 'inns', each one representing a different country from where the knights originated. Close by, the 15th-century Knight's Hospital houses the Archaeological Museum, while the nearby Byzantine Museum displays religious icons and frescoes in the former cathedral. <br />
<br />
Also take a look at the pink 16th-century Mosque of Suleiman the Magnificent, built when Rhodes was controlled by the Ottomans. A short distance southwest of town, overlooking the sea, the Acropolis of Ancient Rhodes is home to the Temple of Apollo.<br />
<br />
Many cruise companies also offer a half-day excursion by bus to Lindos, a whitewashed hillside village crowned by a medieval fortress and an ancient Greek temple. <br />

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>This produced the <strong>caldera</strong> (sea-filled crater), now overlooked by the whitewashed, cliff-top settlements of Fira (the capital) and Oia. Featured on countless picture postcards, <strong>Fira</strong> and Oia cater primarily for couples on romantic escapes, and therefore popular wedding and honeymoon destinations.<br />
<br />
Cruise ships put down anchor in the caldera and passengers are taken ashore on tender boats to <strong>Skala</strong>, below Fira. They then ride up to town by cable car or mule - athletic types can choose to climb the <strong>580-step footpath</strong>.</p>
<p>The most stunning of <a href="/i/greece">Greece</a>'s Cycladic islands, <strong>Santorini</strong> gained its present appearance when a volcanic explosion blew out the island's centre some 3,600 years ago.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Fira's winding, cobbled streets are packed with small hotels, restaurants and cafes, the most memorable (and most expensive) affording caldera views. There are also a couple of museums.<br />
<br />
Cruise companies offer a range of excursions including up-market Oia, noted for its typical Cycladic architecture and unforgettable sunsets, and the tiny charred islands of the caldera, known for their therapeutic volcanic muds. Connoisseurs might also visit the Boutari winery for a guided tour and wine-tasting session - Santorini makes some of the Greek islands' best white wines and Boutari is the island's largest producer. One of Santorini's top attractions, Akrotiri archaeological site, is unfortunately closed for restoration, and looks unlikely to reopen before 2010 or 2011.<br />

								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Modern Olympia is a straggling village centring on a single main street lined with hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops. From here, its just a 10-minute walk to Ancient Olympia archaeological site.<br /><br />Originally a place of worship, Olympia's earliest buildings were dedicated to the gods. See the seventh-century BC Temple of Hera, where the Olympic torch is still lit (using sunlight and a mirror), and the fifth-century BC Temple of Zeus, dedicated to the king of the gods. The games themselves were held in the Ancient Stadium, which was entered through an arched gateway, still in existence. Just like today, the event was held every four years, though only free male Greek citizens could compete. Also be sure to look in the splendid Archaeological Museum of Olympia, displaying marble statues from the Temple of Zeus.<br /><strong><br />Highlights <br /></strong>• Ancient Stadium<br />• Temple of Zeus<br />• Temple of Hera <br />• Archaeological Museum of Olympia</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The city seized the limelight again in the late 1970s when insurgent shipyard workers set in motion a chain of events that helped topple the Berlin Wall. <br />
<br />
Today Gdansk still impresses cruise passengers with its vast shipyards.&nbsp;It also treats those on a Baltic cruise&nbsp;to one of Europe's most attractive old towns - a compact historical core complete with Flemish mansions and a riot of handsome civic buildings. Most cruise ships dock in nearby fellow tri-city Gydnia.&nbsp;Arriving in the sunniest port in <a href="/i/poland">Poland</a>, cruise passengers are greeted by a sweeping view of the tri-cities (Gdansk, Gdynia and Sopot) as they stretch out across the Gulf of Gdansk, with the urban conurbation flanked by the lush Moraine Hills. Gdansk made a dramatic entrance onto the international stage in 1939 when Nazi warships pounded Westerplatte.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The Solidarity Monument is a poignant tribute to the shipyard workers who lost their lives standing up to the might of the Soviet Union and helped change the face of European history. Standing at the mouth of the Baltic Sea, the open-air museum at Westerplatte marks the spot where WWII began.<br />
<br />
The waterfront proper meanwhile is home to the first steamship built in the city, a mammoth 15th-century crane and the fascinating Maritime Museum. Away from the Motlawa River, most of Gdansk's key sights are located on or around the Royal Way. Formed by Long Street and Long Market, its impressive sights include imposing city gates, Flemish mansions and the towering Town Hall. The latter is home to the city's history museum and also offers great views from its precipitous tower. One of the great pleasures here is walking along the 'way' marvelling at the intricate architecture and painstaking reconstructions.<br />
<br />
Gdansk also hosts the largest gothic church in Poland: St Mary's Basilica. This magnificent house of prayer can accommodate around 25,000 worshippers. The beach resort at nearby Sopot<strong> </strong>has Europe's longest pier (500m/1,640ft).<br />
<br />

&bull; Kashubian Lakeland<br />
&bull; Teutonic castles at Malbork and Gniew<br />

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>If you're looking for that special souvenir or gift then the small boutiques that dot the old town are for you.

Specialities such as<span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>Amber, glass and enamelware, handwoven rugs, silverware, handmade jewellery, dolls in regional costumes, woodcarvings and sculptures crafted from clay and metal can all be found in the historic centre of Gdansk.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Both the Royal Way and Gdansk's waterfront are alive with bustling cafes, which are a good place to relax over a coffee or sample some of Poland's distinctive cuisine. Here you can also sample Polish beers like <em>Zywiec</em>, <em>Warka</em> and <em>Elblag</em>, as well as clear or flavoured vodka.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Polish specialities include <em>Barszcz</em> (fermented beetroot soup), <em>Krupnik</em> (barley soup), <em>Kielbasa</em> (smoked sausage), <em>Bigos</em> (meat, cabbage and mushrooms), <em>Golabki</em> (stuffed cabbage leaves), <em>Szarlotka</em> (apple cake), <em>Paczki</em> (jelly doughnuts), <em>Makowiec</em> (poppy seed cake).</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<Hotels><![CDATA[<p>The hotel stock in Gdansk is varied, with rooms ranging from luxurious to very basic. Rooms in the centre of the old town tend to command the highest premiums, though this is not always the case. Good deals can be found on the fringes of the historic quarter and further out.</p>]]></Hotels>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Gdansk has a maritime climate with warm summers and mild autumns. The city basks in daytime highs that reach the low 20°Cs (low 70°Fs) during July and August, but temperatures struggle to climb above 1ºC (34°F) in January and February.

							<General>
								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>Cradle of the Renaissance and home of the Medici family - <a href="/i/italy">Italy</a>'s most progressive art patrons - <a href="/i/florence">Florence</a> houses some of the world's greatest treasures. Florence is around 75 minutes away from Livorno. Pisa, best known for its <strong>Leaning Tower</strong> but also home to a busy university, fine Romanesque churches and pretty squares, is just 20-25 minutes away. For those who have visited these famous sites, charming historic <strong>Lucca</strong>, 45 minutes to the north, is an option. <br /><br /><br />The undistinguished port of <strong>Livorno</strong> (also know as <strong>Leghorn</strong>) is the gateway to <strong>Tuscany</strong> and in particular the cities of <strong>Florence</strong> (<em>Firenze</em>) and <strong>Pisa</strong>.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>While Florence has a plethora of famous sights, its city centre is small and much of it is pedestrianised. The biggest danger is cultural overload so don't try and see it all in one go (which is impossible anyway!). Arm yourself with a good map and avoid Mondays when many places are closed. Likewise, the main attractions in Pisa are clustered in one area, so this is also easy to cover on foot.<br /><br /><strong>Highlights <br />Florence</strong><br />• Duomo di Santa Maria del Fiore (cathedral).<br />• Galleria degli Uffizi (Uffizi Gallery): the most important art collection in Italy.<br />• Galleria dell'Accademia (Accademia Gallery): houses Michaelangelo's <em>David</em>.<br />• Ponte Vecchio: the famous Old Bridge home to gold and silversmiths. <br />• Museo Nazionale del Bargello:<em> </em>Tuscany's finest sculptures.<br />• Santa Croce: and the elegant Franciscan church.<br />• Medici Chapels: family tombs dating back to the 16th century.<br /><strong>Pisa<br /></strong>• Torre Pendente (Leaning Tower): recently stabilized and re-opened to visitors.<br />• Duomo: 11th-century gothic<em> </em>cathedral.</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>High-quality leather produce, gold and silverware and marbled paper are top buys. The area around Santa Croce is home to the Florence's leather-makers, while the Oltrarno is cluttered with the workshops of local gold and silversmiths - although the Ponte Vecchio is home to the glitzier shops. Similar items can be found in Pisa, as well as numerous souvenirs of the Leaning Tower.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Try <em>Bistecca alla fiorentina</em> (thick T-bone steak grilled over charcoal), <em>minestrone alla fiorentina</em> (vegetable soup), <em>pappardelle alla lepre</em> (pasta with hare sauce), <em>panforte di <a href="/i/siena">Siena</a></em> (confection of honey and candied fruits) and <em>castagnaccio</em> (chestnut cake).</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>The climate is typically Mediterranean in the summer but can be quite cool and wet in winter. July and August are very hot. April to June or September to October are good times to visit with fewer crowds and pleasant, comfortable weather. Dress warmly if visiting November to February.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Formerly considered a rather drab and grey place, its atmosphere has, thanks to its inhabitants, returned to reclaim the city's pre-war spirit, fully justifying its nickname: 'Porte Océane', or 'Ocean Gate'.<br /><br />Le Havre stands by the Seine Bay, some 200km (125 miles) west of <a href="/i/paris">Paris</a>, and is also the country's main embarkation point for cruise ships.<br />Although utterly devastated during WWII, the centre of Le Havre, <a href="/i/france">France</a>'s biggest port, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 for its 'innovative utilisation of concrete's potential'.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Heavily bombed during the last war, Le Havre lost most of its historic buildings. However, the main church, Notre Dame Cathedral, was only partially destroyed, and was subsequently rebuilt to form an elegant counterpoint to the modern architecture surrounding it.<br /><br />Other surviving historical buildings of note include the 18th-century Shipowner's House.<br /><br />Numerous museums and galleries provide cultural interest, and in summer, there are several beaches for the sun-seekers.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• Malraux Art Museum<br />• Museum of Natural History<br />• The Corinne le Monnier Gallery<br />• Saint Joseph's Church<br />• Japanese Garden<br />• Day trips in rural Normandy</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>There are three principal shopping areas. Halles Centrales district is close to the cruise port, and offers several streets of specialist shops. Saint Vincent district caters for those in search of designer goods, clothing, jewellery and other luxury goods, while the Coty shopping centre features 80 outlets on three floors. Specialist items include fashion, French delicatessen, and of course, cheese.</p>]]></Shopping>
								<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>France is, as everyone knows, proud of its cuisine, and cruise passengers will find cafes and restaurants dotted around the city. From light snacks such as <em>croque monsieur</em> to Normandy oysters and full-blown three-course meals, there is no shortage of dining possibilities.</p>]]></Restaurants>
								<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>Normandy has a temperate maritime climate, with cool damp winters and warm, occasionally hot, summers. However it can rain at any time of year, so waterproofs are advisable. Average temperatures range from around 3°C (37°F) in January to 23° (74°) in August.</p>]]></WhenToGo>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>One of the great pleasures of arriving by cruise ship is the proximity of the port to the Old Town. <br /><br />The seafront is characterised by palm trees, look-out towers and white-fronted houses; the landmark twin towers of the Baroque Cathedral are just a couple of blocks away from the mooring. <br /><br />Cádiz is the gateway to Jerez de la Frontera and the great Moorish city of <a href="/i/seville">Seville</a>. Also on the doorstep is the Doñana National Park, one of <a href="/i/europe">Europe</a>'s last great wildernesses.<br />Set in the southwestern corner of Andalucia, Cádiz is one of the oldest cities in the Western World and was founded by the Phoenicians around 1100 BC.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Cádiz has few specific tourist sights. Instead, its appeal lies in the shabby-chic charm of its Old Town, and a stroll round the walls and a promenade along the adjacent beach front is a very popular way to spend a couple of hours here.<br /><strong><br />Highlights</strong><br />• In the Old Town pay a visit to the 18th-century Cathedral and the Museo de Cádiz.<br />• Jerez, 30 mins away, is famous as the home of sherry and a trip to a bodega is <em>de rigeur</em> while horse lovers will not want to miss the show (and much more) at the Royal Equestrian School.<br />• Seville, 1½-2 hours by coach, is one of the great cities of Europe. Its <a href="/i/santa-cruz-cruise">Santa Cruz</a> quarter is quintessential romantic Southern Spain while its Real <em>Alcázar</em>  (palace-fortress of the Arab kings), and its <em>Cathedral</em>, complete with Giralda Tower, are two of the country's greatest monuments.<br />• Lovers of nature and bird watchers should visit the Doñana National Park; boat trips depart from Sanlúcar de Barrameda (11 miles north).</p>]]></Sightseeing>

												<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The most easterly of the Canaries,&nbsp;<a href="http://manage.worldtravelguide.net/i/spain/canary-islands/lanzarote">Lanzarote</a>&nbsp;is a dry and spectacular island which owes its eerie inland moonscape to the activity of&nbsp;volcanoes<strong>&nbsp;</strong>long since dormant.&nbsp;The volcanic ash and craters have now been turned to the islanders' advantage in a novel and very picturesque method of vine cultivation. <br />
<br />
The island's capital and cruise port, Arrecife, is on the southeast coast. It has has an attractive palm-lined promenade backed by restored colonial-era buildings. From the cruise port it is a short distance to almost anywhere on the island, with the main highlights all within an hour's drive or less.<br />
&nbsp;</p>]]></Overview>
												<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Lanzarote is famous for its strict conservation ethic and, above all, its other-worldly volcanic landscapes which have been enhanced by the inspired landscaped creations of island genius, C&eacute;sar Manrique (1919-1992). Even a short tour of the island should allow you to take in three or four of the amazing and often surreal seven set-piece <em>Centros de Arte, Cultura y Tusimo</em> attractions that are his legacy.  <br />
<strong><br />
Highlights:</strong><br />
&bull; Arrecife's beautiful Museum of International Art in an old fortress, visible as you cruise into the port.<br />
&bull; Teguise, the wonderfully preserved Spanish Colonial ex-capital.<br />
&bull; Jameos del Agua: A spectacular C&eacute;sar Manrique fantasy grotto, created from the natural volcanic landscape. <br />
&bull; The adjacent (unadorned) volcanic cave system of <em>Los Verdes</em>. <br />
&bull; A trip around the National Park of Timanfaya<em>,</em> an awe-inspiring landscape of volcanoes and volcanic debris which covers nearly one-third of the island.</p>]]></Sightseeing>

The north and centre of the island is cooler, wetter, and retains more of a Spanish <strong>colonial atmosphere</strong>. The dramatic lush interior features spectacular <strong>volcanic peaks</strong>.  <br /><br />The capital of Las Palmas functions as both a <strong>cosmopolitan city</strong> (it's actually the biggest in the Canaries), and seaside resort that's popular with both Spanish and foreign tourists alike.

												<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Most of the island's top sights are in the north, situated within 30 minutes or so of Las Palmas. However, Las Palmas itself has a variety of first-class attractions plus an excellent golden beach, Playa de las Canteras, which is a 15-minute walk from the cruise terminal (as is the city centre).<br /><strong><br />Highlights:</strong><br />• Casa de Colón (Columbus House): The beautiful 15th-century military governor's residence where Columbus may have stayed when en route to the New World. <br />• Mercado de Vegueta: A cornucopia of local fish, fruit, vegetables and cheese on offer at the city's oldest market (established 1854).<br />• Pueblo Canario: A charming re-creation of a traditional village.<br />• Museums: Explore the Science and Technology Museum, which is next to the cruise terminal, and the Museo Canario, with its fascinating mummies and trepanned skulls belonging to aboriginal Canarians. <br />• Golf: The Real Club de Golf Bandama, 9.65 km (6 miles) from Las Palmas, is the oldest in <a href="/i/spain">Spain</a> and enjoys a magnificent setting.</p>]]></Sightseeing>

												<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The first glimpse of the town from the cruise ship is that of a fortress-like settlement perched high above the sea, protected by cliffs and ramparts. In fact, once on land, the little island capital is a relatively modest town. <br />
<br />
At the opposite end of the island Ciudadella is the former island capital, well worth a visit for its architecture, atmosphere and shopping. Dotted amid the rural and largely uncommercialised Menorcan countryside are several prehistoric remains from the Talayot civilisation of the 2nd millennium BC, while the coast is famous for its cove beaches.<br />
<br />
The fjord-like harbour of Mahon (Ma&oacute; in Castilian) is one of the largest natural harbours in the world.</p>]]></Overview>
												<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Mahon is an attractive hybrid of British colonial and Spanish-style architecture and its narrow streets and little squares repay exploration. On the waterfront catamarans and glass-bottom boats ply pleasure cruises. Ciudadella is a charming warren of elegant 18th- and 19th-century mansions, palaces and churches. <br />
<br />
<strong>Highlights<br />
</strong>&bull; Talat&iacute; de Dalt and Naveta d'es Tudons: two of the most spectacular of the island's several prehistoric formations. <br />
&bull; Ciudadella: its superb Gothic-Baroque Catedral de Menorca, its picturesque arcaded shopping street, Ses Voltes, and quaint old market area.<br />
&bull; Beaches: the idyllic white-sand coves of Cala Mitjana, Cala Turqueta, Cala Macarella and Cala Tr&eacute;baluge near Cala Galdana.<br />
&bull; Binib&egrave;quer Vell: a picture-postcard re-creation of a typical fishermen's village, close to Mahon.<br />

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />The historic centre and port enjoys a stunning setting, atop a limestone plateau, tucked into a crescent-shaped bay surrounded by the rugged <strong>Taurus Mountains</strong>. <br /><br />Cruise ships dock in the commercial harbour, also boasting a spectacular mountain backdrop, some 25 m (40 km) from Antalya's historic centre. The principal attractions are the charming <strong>Old Town</strong>, known as Kaleiçi, and nearby ancient ruins, notably Termessos, Perge and Aspendos (the latter two are combined in a popular half-day tour).<br />Situated on the Mediterranean coast of south western <a href="/i/turkey">Turkey</a>, Antalya is the fourth largest city in Turkey though cruise holidaymakers see none of its modern sprawl.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The Old Town comprises a<strong> </strong>delightful maze of steep narrow streets lined with carpet shops, restaurants and boutique hotels, many occupying elegant restored Ottoman houses, curving down to the ancient harbour. The Konyaalti seafront is a wonderful place to take the evening air.<br /><strong><br />Highlights:<br /></strong>• Antalya Museum: a world-class archaeological collection housing the finest exhibits from classical sites right along the Mediterranean coast.<br />• Aspendos: its superb Roman theatre is said to be the best preserved in Asia Minor.<br />• Perge: dating back to 1000 BC the well preserved theatre of Perge could once seat 14,000 people.<br />• Termessos: with its dramatic setting and very well preserved remains this is one of Turkey's finest ancient sites 30km south east of Antalya. <br />• Gulet cruise: Take a half-day trip on a beautiful traditional wooden Turkish-style gulet coastal boat, to include the beautiful Düden Falls.</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Shopping><![CDATA[<p>The Old Town is a very colourful place to shop, with everything from designer leather to antique carpets, spices and Turkish delight to fake Rolex and all manner of traditional handicrafts. Expect to be approached by sales people and haggling is the norm. Buying a carpet, or other expensive items, can be a lengthy process, involving taking tea with the sales merchants.</p>]]></Shopping>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p>The approach by cruise ship to Bodrum is spectacular, with the bay dominated by the <strong>Crusader Castle of St Peter</strong>, then a forest of masts along the shore, many belonging to the traditional wooden Turkish sailing boats (<em>gulets</em>) which grace the busy harbour. <br /><br />The Cruise Ship Terminal is a stone's throw from the centre of town. The centre has been heavily developed for European tourists since it was 'discovered' in the 1970s, but despite this, and heavy summer crowds, it retains (at least for first-time visitors) an exotic Turkish atmosphere with plenty of visual interest and a busy nightlife<br />Bodrum is not only the major resort but also the most attractive town on <a href="/i/turkey">Turkey</a>'s beautiful Aegean Coast.</p>]]></Overview>
								<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>The Castle of St Peter is the dominant landmark in this low-rise whitewashed Mediterranean scene. Bodrum is the site of the Mausoleum, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Only a few fragments remain though curiosity alone may dictate a visit. Aside from these sights Bodrum is light on monuments but compensates with a wealth of bars and shops, many of which reflect the town's status as an important centre for Turkish and foreign artists.<br /><br /><strong>Highlights:<br /></strong>• Castle of St Peter: this classic Crusader castle on the waterfront offers great sea views, an interesting Byzantine shipwreck hall and spooky dungeons.<br />• Bodrum Amphitheatre: another structure from the reign of King Mausolus (4C BC), this once held up to 13,000 people and now offers the classic picture postcard views over the castle and harbour.<br />• A <strong>'</strong>Blue Cruise':  sailing along the Turkish coastline on a beautifully crafted Turkish <em>gulet</em>, is an essential part of a Turkish trip, even if it is only for a few hours.</p>]]></Sightseeing>

								<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />The cruise terminal is off the main harbour and a short walk from the centre. As you sail into the sheltered bay, note Pigeon Island, an islet tethered to the mainland by a long causeway. The Old Town walls still stand and are now home to dozens of shops, restaurants, cafes and nightspots. By day the town is relatively quiet as most of its visitors are out at the surrounding beaches. By night however it is heaving, with the epicenter being Barlar Sokak ('Pub Lane').<br /><br /><br />Kusadasi is one of the liveliest and most popular resorts on <a href="/i/turkey">Turkey</a>'s Aegean coast and is favoured by a mix of locals, British package tourists - who come for the sandy beaches, shopping and prolific nightlife - and cruise ship holidaymakers who use it as a gateway to the ruins of Ephesus.</p>]]></Overview>

										<Overview><![CDATA[<p>It is often called 'God's Floating Garden', reflecting the wonderful flora to be found here. <a href="/i/portugal/madeira">Madeira</a> is also famous for its beautiful and extensive network of <em>levada </em>walks which follow, on gentle gradients, irrigation channels. <br /><br />Funchal is the island capital and is easily the liveliest and most interesting place on Madeira, home to the best hotels, restaurants and nightlife. Despite its numerous visitor attractions it still maintains a vibrant local life of its own.<br />Madeira is a spectacularly beautiful island, lush with vineyards and rich farmland, pitted with valleys, topped by spectacular peaks and with a coastline of sheer cliffs.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>Funchal enjoys a magnificent setting on the Bay of Funchal, rising up from the sea in a natural amphitheatre, and the perfect way of arriving is by cruise ship. Coaches will whisk you right around the island though there is more than enough to do and see in and around Funchal. <br /><br />The city centre is gratifyingly small, and its narrow cobbled streets host a splendid market, some intriguing little museums, shops and cafes, a salty old port area, and can easily be covered on foot. There are fine gardens to enjoy, even in the town centre, but a 5-10 minute taxi ride will take you to the island's finest <em>quintas </em>(estates) and gardens. <br /><strong><br />Highlights </strong><br />• Funchal: The Mercado dos Lavradores, a very colourful market of fresh produce and handicrafts; the 15th-century catedral; Quinta das Cruzes; the Adegas São Francisco wine cellars and museum. <br />• Glorious Gardens on the outskirts of  Funchal include Jardim Botânico, Quinta da Boa Vista, Palheiro (Blandy) Gardens and Monte Palace Tropical Gardens (reached by cable car from Funchal centre).<br />• Further afield: Camacha (heart of the wickerwork industry), Câmara de Lobos (a picturesque fishing port), Cabo Girão (one of the highest sea cliffs in the world, São Vicente (the prettiest village on the island). <em></em></p>]]></Sightseeing>

										<Overview><![CDATA[<p><br />
<br />
The principal port and touristic heart of the <a href="/i/portugal/azores">Azores</a> is the archipelago's capital, Ponta Delgada, on S&atilde;o Miguel island.<br />
<br />
First settled six centuries ago by fishermen attracted by the sheltered harbour, Ponta Delgada is nowadays a modern and cosmopolitan city, but retains a tranquil island feel and many architectural testaments to its past.<br />
<br />
The Azores are largely unspoilt, and a great whale-watching destination.<br />
Mysterious and remote, to those who haven't experienced them, the nine Azores Islands lie 1,500 km (950 miles) west of <a href="/i/portugal">Portugal</a> in the mid-Atlantic, and as such form a popular port of call for cruise ships sailing between <a href="/i/europe">Europe</a> and the Americas.</p>]]></Overview>
										<Sightseeing><![CDATA[<p>While away the hours in the historic centre of this former fishing village, which boasts narrow streets, attractive whitewashed houses and a waterfront promenade.<br />
<br />
The northern suburb of Faj&atilde; de Cima is famous for festivals, so if the timing is right it's worth a visit. And it's also a good idea, having explored the city centre on foot, to take a short trip out into the stunning and lush natural surroundings that typify the rest of S&atilde;o Miguel, not least the nearby Sete Cidades mountains and lake.<br />
<br />
<strong>Highlights</strong><br />
&bull; Santana Palace<br />
&bull; Carlos Machado museum<br />

A smaller shopping centre, Sol-Mar, is situated in the city centre, while numerous smaller shops and boutiques line the city centre streets. Locally made linens and woollen goods, lace and pottery make good buys, as do the local brandy and hand-rolled cigars.</p>]]></Shopping>
										<Restaurants><![CDATA[<p>Plenty of restaurants and cafés are there to tempt the cruise visitor to Ponta Delgada. Food is Portuguese style with a local twist. Local specialities include seafood, shellfish, beef stews and cheese.</p>]]></Restaurants>
										<WhenToGo><![CDATA[<p>The Azores benefit from a temperate, maritime climate with mild winters (average daytime temperatures range from 12-15ºC/54-59ºF) and warm summers. Humidity is reasonably high and the wettest months are October to March.</p>]]></WhenToGo>
