								<Body><![CDATA[<p>At nearly 1.2 million hectares (3 million acres) in size, Fiordland National Park is New Zealand&rsquo;s largest national park &ndash; a breathtaking stretch of coastal landscape that typifies the country&rsquo;s natural splendour. Created in 1952, it is a land of ice, beech forests, mountains and waterfalls that tumble into the ocean below. One of the park&rsquo;s most famous sights is Milford Sound, which is the largest glacier-carved fiord on New Zealand&rsquo;s coastline and attracts large numbers of sightseers and cruise ships every year. Popular activities in the park include hiking, sea kayaking, diving, cycling, golf, fishing and sailing. The Milford Track, which stretches some 53.5km (33 miles) from Glade Wharf to Sandfly Point, has been described as the finest walk in the world, taking visitors on a rugged, alpine journey through the park&rsquo;s most breathtaking scenery. Visitors should, however, note that a permit is required for the track and the hut accommodation along its length, and these must be booked through the Visitor Centre in Te Anau.</p>]]></Body>

						<Content>
							<General>
								<Body><![CDATA[<p>Originally a gift to Queen Victoria from the Tuwharetoa Maori chief Te Heuheu Tukino IV in 1887, Tongariro National Park was the first national park in New Zealand and the fourth oldest in the world. The park is of religious and cultural importance to the Maoris who first occupied the area in the ninth century when they arrived from Polynesia. They believed the region's mountains had god-like ancestors, and the core of the park centres around three active volcanoes, Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and the largest, Ruapehu, which erupted in a spectacular fashion in 1995 and again in 1996. Some areas resemble a lunar landscape, which has been created by flowing lava, alongside forests and tussock lands. The Tongariro Crossing (<a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz" target="_blank">www.doc.govt.nz</a>), completed by about 70,000 hikers every summer, is considered to be one of the best one-day walks in the country, offering magnificent volcanic scenery and fine views of Lake Taupo and Mt Taranaki. Mt Ruapehu is also the focal point for skiing on the North Island, with resorts at Whakapapa and Turoa providing access to New Zealand&rsquo;s largest ski area, where there are lots of ski runs and options for cross-country and ski touring.</p>]]></Body>

									<General>
										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Created in 1845, Auckland Domain is the city's oldest, largest and most attractive park. It features semi-formal gardens, a sculpture walk, pathways and ponds, as well as a winter garden with cool and tropical houses; in addition, the Fernz Fernery features over 100 types of fern. The 81-hectare (202-acre) domain is situated on an extinct volcano, known as <em>pukekawa</em> or &lsquo;hill of bitter memories'.</p>
<p>Within the domain is the Auckland War Memorial Museum, the city's most visited attraction, where contemporary displays are juxtaposed by the building's Greco-Roman style architecture. The ground floor is devoted to &lsquo;The Pacific people', the middle to &lsquo;Natural History' and the top to &lsquo;New Zealand&rsquo;s War Stories'. A small area on the middle floor is dedicated to the Children's Discovery Centre. The displays include various interactive and audiovisual components, and the museum also houses one of New Zealand's most important collections of Maori and South Pacific artefacts. Each day, visitors can experience Maori cultural performances of song, heralded by a conch blast that reverberates through the museum at 1100, 1200 and 1330 (and 1430 from Nov-Mar).</p>]]></Body>

<p>In the Heritage Gallery, international artists include Breughel and Millais, with Reynolds and Gainsborough providing a link back to colonial days. Some of the most memorable images are those by Gottfried Lindauer and Charles F Goldie, who depict passive portraits of Maori with moko (facial tattoos). The Heritage Gallery is currently closed for a massive, multi-million dollar redevelopment and is due to reopen in mid 2011. During this time, the Auckland Art Gallery will continue to operate through the New Gallery building, which will show both old and new works, as well as host exhibitions, education and public programmes.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand's tallest building stands 328m (1,076ft) high in the centre of Auckland, dominating the skyline. A lift service takes 40 seconds to whizz visitors to the first observation platforms. From here, the views are breathtaking enough but even more so from the very top level, from where visitors can look out over the harbour as well as the city.</p>
<p>The tower is one part of the Sky City complex - a casino with cafes, bars and a restaurant. Visitors should note that anyone spending a minimum amount dining here receives a free pass to the very top of the tower. It is possible for visitors to climb even higher, to the crow's nest or Sky Deck, a further 50m (164ft) up, as part of the Sky Walk experience, which involves walking around the 192m (630ft) exterior halo of the tower without rails but with safety harness.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is the world's longest tower-based jump, where a harness and attached wire allow for a 25-second, 192m (630ft) arrested free-fall, eye-popping descent where you reach speeds of 85kph (53mph). Adrenaline junkies can keep their suits on and repeat the experience or cross the road and do an inverted bungy, called Skyscreamer.</p>]]></Body>

The 2.25-hectare (5.5-acre) garden on the volcanic slopes of Mount Eden (the highest point in the area and extremely popular with tour buses) served as a quarry until 1965. It was during this year that a group of dedicated volunteers began to transform the space into the internationally acclaimed showcase garden that it is today. The garden contains the largest collection of camellias in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as large numbers of rhododendrons and azaleas.&nbsp;Plants from around the world provide year-round colour, but visitors can see a large number of native plants too. The landscaped gardens are home to various statues and a 13.5m (45ft) waterfall.</p>]]></Body>

You can often spot whales, sharks, dolphins and turtles offshore. Stretching over 120km (75 miles) from tip-to-tip and covering an area of 165,280 hectares (408,423 acres), Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world. Characterised by its stunning freshwater lakes, coloured sand cliffs, lush rainforests growing in the sand, secluded creeks and long, white sandy beaches, the idyllic island attracts thousands of visitors each year who come on 4x4-led camping trips or to stay in lodges including the new award-winning eco lodge, Kingfisher Bay, built on the island's west coast. Aside from its swimming holes, creeks and stunning natural beauty, other attractions on the island include the rusting wreck of the Maheno ship which ran aground during a cyclone in 1935 and the former logging camp of Central Station that's now home to an exhibition about the island's unique environment.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Affectionately known as 'the Coathanger', the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a feat of engineering genius. Opening in 1932, it took 1,400 workers (16 of whom died in the process), eight years, and $20 million to complete. The best way to experience the bridge is to climb it, and Bridge Climb gives thrill-seekers the chance to walk to the top of the 50-story-high bridge (over the cars and trains rumbling across the deck below) and down the other side. If you're afraid of heights or on a budget, you can walk or cycle across the bridge free of charge. Use the aptly named "Bridge Stairs" on Cumberland Street in the Rocks for an hour-long, round-trip stroll.</p>]]></Body>

During the summer, visitors jostle for towel space on the beach while the promenade bustles with activity. Campbell Parade serves up a mixture of busy bars, seaside cafes, and the ever-popular Sunday market. Topless sunbathing is tolerated and swimmers should always swim within the patrolled areas marked by the red and yellow flags. The coastal walk, which starts at Bondi's southern end and runs along the coast to Coogee, is a must for any visitor, especially in October and November when the annual "Sculptures by the Sea" is on.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Perth's postmodern celebration of Australia's Bicentenary in 1988, the Bell Tower, is located at the foot of Barrack Street, on the Swan River Foreshore. Home to the Swan Bells, the 80m (260ft) tower is a unique design resulting from an architectural competition. It houses the 18 historic bells from St Martin-in-the-Fields - a gift to Perth from the City of London for Australia's Bicentenary. Visitors can go up the tower, while the surrounding development contains shops, restaurants, cafés, a pub, a tourist information centre, cruise boat offices and docks. You can hear the bells ring Thu-Sun from 1200-1300.</p>]]></Body>

It took three years to complete its construction in 1929, but work on the intricate interiors continued for another decade. With its towering granite columns, a huge statue-flanked stairway leading to grand entrance, and a 91m-high (300ft) dome topped by a replica of a 16th century Florentine sculpture of the god Mercury, inside is a sight to behold. A major, restoration project – the largest of its kind ever undertaken in Havana Vieja - began in 2012, with the iconic dome currently under scaffolding. Works are due to be completed in late 2017; until then, it remains closed to visitors.</p>]]></Body>

While visiting a cemetery isn&rsquo;t for everyone, the innumerable Carrara marble sculptures &ndash; from the sacred to the whimsical &ndash; make a stop here worth it, at least for a few photos. In Cuba, the dead are buried in stone crypts with aboveground capstones and wandering among the manicured streets within the cemetery can be an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>Among the graves worth a look include &lsquo;La Milagrosa,&rsquo; who died in childbirth and was buried with her child at her feet; legend has it when she was exhumed, the infant was in her arms. Pregnant women visit the grave to make offerings in return for a healthy birth. Other notable gravesites include those of author Alejo Carpentier, actress Rita Montaner, and student activist Eduardo Chibas. Maps are sold at the entrance (CUC1).</p>

<p>A small chapel, El Templete, with an interesting fresco by French artist Jean Baptiste Vermay, was built in 1828 to mark the spot. A ceiba tree, similar to the one under which the first mass in Cuba was held, faces the chapel. Every 16 November, Habaneros take a turn around the ceiba for good luck.</p>
<p>Also here is the Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum), in the magnificent Palacio de los Capitanes Generales, once home to the highest colonial authority in Cuba. This museum gives an overview of Havana's history and has a good gift shop - don't miss Cuba's only wooden 'cobblestone' street in front.<br />
<br />
The oldest building in this square is the impressive Castillo de le Real Fuerza, a 16th-century colonial fortress surrounded by a moat, today housing the Museo de la Cer&aacute;mica Art&iacute;stica.</p>

<p>But to pay true homage to the master of literary economy, do as he did and start the evening with a mojito, a delicious blend of rum and mint, in La Bodeguita del Medio, and continue with another of his favourite tipples, a daiquiri, in El Floridita.</p>]]></Body>

Due to the risk of flooding and the high summer temperatures the hiking trail is only open from 1 May to 31 August. Whilst in the area, you can also visit the Quiver Tree (Kokerboom) Forest to see these bizarrely elegant giant aloes, once used by the San people to make quivers for their arrows and now protected.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Formerly known as the National Museum, this attraction close to the Botanic Gardens contains some snapshots of Tanzania&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage. It retains famous fossil discoveries made by paleoanthropologist and archaeologist, Louis Leakey, in Olduvai Gorge, plus historical displays on regional civilisations, the development of the slave trade and the German and British colonial periods of Tanzania's history.  It is hard to avoid the fact that the collection, as it stands, is limited and somewhat patchy, but it&rsquo;s interesting nonetheless. Exhibits range quirkily from historic craft exhibits and prehistoric skulls to guides on ridding a house of termites.  The museum also has an attractive courtyard and a caf&eacute; shaded by a huge Banyan tree.</p>]]></Body>

Don&rsquo;t come expecting anything too sleek however &ndash; roads here still tend to be rocky, while the chief attraction is not chic shopping but the beach bars at Oyster Bay or the sundown views from the restaurants on Msasani&rsquo;s western coast. Many of Dar&rsquo;s better restaurants and a few good bars are also clustered here, and the contrast with the busy, bustling centre is striking.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Just ten kilometres (six miles) from the city centre is Nairobi National Park, a fabulous stretch of wilderness home to most of the Big Five (lions, buffalos, leopards and black rhinoceros) as well as Thompson's Gazelle, zebra and wildebeest. Established in 1946, Kenya's first National Park has a backdrop of city skyscrapers and is home to several animal sanctuaries including the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. Despite its proximity to the city, the 117 sq km (45 sq miles) park is also on several migration routes and attracts a large number of herbivores, including giraffes. Around 400 bird species and scores of plants, including several floras unique to the area, complete an impressive picture.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Close to the Nairobi National Park, the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage is run by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and takes in elephant calves orphaned by poachers or angry villagers. Although it's open for just an hour a day, the touching sight of tiny elephants playing in the mud with their keepers is worth the effort alone. Visitor donations are spent on keeping the calves well looked after, as well as rescue missions which involve picking up and transporting the animals from across Kenya to the orphanage. Once old enough, the elephants are released into Tsavo National Park.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Despite the obvious risks associated with visiting a slum, trips to Kibera - Africa's largest urban shanty town -are becoming increasingly popular, with visitors anxious to get a taste of the sharp side of life in the Kenyan capital. Home to an estimated 250,000 people Kibera is a vast urban sprawl six kilometres (four miles) from the city centre, divided into 13 'villages'. Guided tours usually include visits to local craftsmen and schools. It's best to go with a respected and responsible tour company as those who have attempted to go it alone have found themselves confronted with muggers.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>With the ability to accommodate 25,000 worshippers inside and another 80,000 in its courtyard, Casablanca's Hassan II Mosque is a truly monumental complex right next to the sea. It covers a site of 9 hectares (22 acres), making it the world's second largest religious building after the main Masjid al-Haram mosque in Mecca. Commenced in 1980 and opened in 1993, it has been the inspired work of French architect Michel Pineau and some 35,000 Moroccan craftsmen. The amazingly ornate minaret is the world's tallest, standing 210m (656ft) high while two laser beams reach 30km (18.5 miles) towards Mecca. The vast prayer hall even has a sliding roof that can be opened to the heavens.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The medina of Casablanca is the oldest part of the city, dating back to before the French protectorate. Two of the original gates of the old city walls still survive. Other attractions include an 18th-century fortress, a jewellery market, and the tomb of Sidi Allal el-Kairouani, who became the city's patron saint in 1350. The medina has not always been the safest part of the city to walk around, but today its mix of Moorish and Portuguese architecture is compelling, as is the fragment of traditional life that survives here. You'll pass children playing football, stalls piled high with fruit and vegetables, cafes serving mint tea, and little shops of every description. In some ways, this is the most Moroccan-feeling part of Casablanca.</p>]]></Body>

									<General>
										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Modelled on the original Casablanca medina, and sometimes known as the 'new medina', the Quartier Habous was constructed by the French during the 1930s. The Habous was supposed to bring French order while preserving Moroccan style, as though to demonstrate the harmonious triumph of occupied life (which came to an end in 1950s). The Moorish-style arches, little lanes and bazaars do a good job of replicating the medina feel. Though there's no substitute for the real thing, it's a good base from which to explore the Royal Palace, and to pick up clothes and traditional pastries.</p>]]></Body>

Set in this modern and well-maintained building is a collection of religious books, costumes and sacramental artefacts. In part, the museum is a celebration of the traditional mutual tolerance and acceptance between the Muslim and Jewish communities of Morocco, the latter having reduced substantially since the creation of the State of Israel, but still numbered in the thousands. When Islamic extremists killed 45 people in attacks on mostly Jewish properties and businesses in 2003, it sparked the country's biggest ever protest demonstration, marching under the banner 'Jews and Muslims; we are all citizens, we are all Moroccans'.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>For an authentic taste of Casablanca's Franco-Moorish past, be sure to visit the Marché Central. An example of a colonial attempt to harmonise French and Moroccan cultures, the so-called Central Market is more an elegant food stop than a chaotic Arab bazaar. If that sounds offensively sanitised, don't be fooled. This is a treasure of pretty white arches, with an impressive ancient gate-style entrance with intricate Arabesques, as well as mounds of spices, vegetables and fish inside. Fresh from the Atlantic, the daily catch arrives in the early morning, and is served grilled in a number of little lunchtime restaurants here.</p>]]></Body>

<p>Created in 1898 to protect the flora and fauna of the South African Lowveld, the park is named after its original proponent, President Paul Kruger. Today, it is home to a wealth of wildlife, including cheetahs, leopards, lions, rhinos, wildebeest, buffalo, elephants, giraffes, antelope and impala. The park is also renowned for its cultural heritage sites, including many native rock art sites.</p>
<p>At Thulamela Hill, visitors can see the excavated remains of a late Iron Age settlement, whilst the village of <em>Masorini</em> provides an excellent example of the way of life of the Stone Age hunter-gatherers who inhabited South Africa long before the first white settlers arrived.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Once a downtown slum, Newtown has undergone radical alterations: the creation of Mary Fitzgerald Square, the Nelson Mandela Bridge and the Metro Mall minibus terminus. The famous MuseuMAfricA and Market Theatre are housed in a magnificent Victorian building that was the city's main market before the stall holders, mainly of Indian origin, were moved to the nearby Oriental Plaza, now an excellent place to savour Indian food or buy clothing and fabric at discount prices. MuseuMAfricA, which incorporates the Bensusan Museum and Library of Photography, the Museum of South Africa Rock Art and the Bernberg Museum of Fashion, was South Africa's first post-apartheid museum. Its exhibits cover a wide range of African themes. The Market Theatre hosted protest plays during the anti-apartheid struggle. The South African Breweries (SAB) World of Beer is dedicated to the brewing process, with beer tastings at the end. There are also mock-ups of a shebeen and a honky-tonk pub.</p>
<p>Newtown is accessed off the M1 or over the Nelson Mandela Bridge from Bertha Street in Braamfontein to Ntemi Piliso Street in Newtown.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Soweto (an acronym for South Western Townships) has become a symbol of victory over oppression. Nelson Mandela lived here before being sentenced to life imprisonment for treason by the former apartheid government. An intimidating labyrinth of tiny council houses, grim-looking dormitory-style, mine-worker hostels and ostentatious mansions, it was originally intended to provide temporary shelter for contract workers toiling underground in the Witwatersrand gold fields, but it's now a lively and characterful district housing around one million people. Due to the absence of street signs and lack of safe public transport, Soweto is best visited with a tour operator that offer fascinating half-day and full-day historical tours or evening trips to the shebeens (informal pubs), with resident guides who really capture the history and character of the place.</p>]]></Body>

However, (literally) beneath the theme-park veneer lies a gold mine that operated from 1887-1971. Tours take visitors down a 200m (656ft) shaft where workers sweated, toiled and died.

Executions took place here in Mameluke times but in the 19th century it acquired a happier reputation when a local saint, Mitwalli, performed miracles near the gate. To this day, people seeking healing nail a lock of hair or piece of clothing to the gate in hopes of receiving divine aid. Rising above the gate are the minarets of the Mosque of Al-Muayyad, which offer some of the finest panoramic views in Cairo from the top. The mosque contains a shady courtyard and the mausoleum of the Sultan Al-Muayyad and his son, who began building the mosque in 1415.</p>]]></Body>

The district is demarked by colossal gates and square towers &ndash; remnants of the old enclosure walls. Beyond them are five important mosques, including the Mosque of Al-Hakim and the Mosque of Al-Azhar. The latter was erected in AD970 as the crowning achievement of the new Fatimid city, and its madrassa is regarded as one of the world&rsquo;s oldest educational institutions, drawing learners from across the Islamic world. It finds an interesting counterpoint in the severe, military style of Al-Hakim, which was completed in 1013.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Ringed by an important thoroughfare in the heart of downtown, Midan Al-Tahrir or &lsquo;Liberation Square&rsquo; has been a symbol of protest since the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. Though tourists came here in the past largely for the Egyptian Museum, it&rsquo;s now recognised across the world as the birthplace of Egypt&rsquo;s 2011 revolution against Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s 30-year rule. It is now relatively quiet, though the situation can change quickly and it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep abreast of the news if considering a visit. Though caution is advised and demonstrations should be avoided, the square is compelling for its graffiti, eclectic visitors from almost all walks of Egyptian life, and festival atmosphere on many afternoons.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>A UNESCO World Heritage site, the medina, or old quarter, of Tunis was built during the seventh century AD. From the 12th to the 16th centuries, Tunis was considered to be one of the greatest and wealthiest cities of the Islamic world and its medina is testimony to its former grandeur. Today, visitors can step back in time through the maze of narrow, winding streets, and barter for souvenirs with the locals; goods on sale include colourful hand-made carpets, hand-crafted jewellery, copper and brassware, pottery and exotic spices.   The endlessly twisting streets can be disorientating, but it's as much fun to give yourself over to random exploration and the happy accidents of discovering traditional craftsmen, food markets and ancient monuments. Among the more frequented attractions found within the walls of the medina are the ninth-century Al-Zaytuna Mosque (Mosque of the Olive Tree), the perfume makers' Souk el Attarine and Tunis's first Ottoman-style mosque, Sidi Yousef, built in the 17th century.</p>]]></Body>

Since Roosevelt never wanted to be pictured in a wheelchair, the monument includes a larger-than-life statue in which he is wearing a floor-length cape. The true-to-scale sculpture, where he is sitting in his wheelchair, was added later. There is also a bronze likeness of Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>]]></Body>

All are encased and displayed in a large marble rotunda. They are difficult to read, but they are the originals from over 200 years ago. The Public Vaults contain fascinating documents such as George Washington's handwritten letters, materials and evidence from famous investigations, such as the Kennedy assassination, and recordings of debates on Prohibition in 1918 and reinstating the Draft in 1940.</p>]]></Body>

Both temperate and tropical plant communities are represented in the park's 610,684 hectares (1,509,000 acres), including cypress swamps, pinelands and sawgrass prairies. Florida Bay, the largest body of water within the park, covering 2072 sq km (800 sq miles), is home to fish, shellfish, coral and sponges. The park is particularly well known for its abundant birdlife. <br/>Other endangered species protected in the park are the Green turtle, the Key Largo Cotton mouse, the American crocodile and the Schaus swallowtail butterfly. The park's five visitor centres provide information on the flora and fauna in the Everglades, as well as details of various park trails. Hiking and canoeing trails start at Flamingo Visitor Centre, Gulf Coast Visitor Centre and Shark Valley Visitor Centre. Shark Valley Centre also hires out bicycles and visitors can take a narrated tram ride or a boat tour of the park.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Designated a national park in 1890, Yosemite National Park stretches along California&rsquo;s eastern flank and covers almost 3108 sq kilometres (1200 sq miles) of alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, cliffs and waterfalls in the central Sierra Nevada mountain range. The park is well known for its giant sequoia trees, particularly in Mariposa Grove where some of the trees are over 3000 years old and reach 80m (219ft) in height. Until 1969, when the tree fell during a heavy storm, it was possible to drive through the 3.4-metre (11.2-foot) tunnel carved through the trunk of the famous Wawona Tunnel Tree. <br />
<br />
Other scenic highlights include Yosemite Falls, which cascade 739m (2425ft) into the valley below and Glacier Point, which offers spectacular views of the park. The area is also home to abundant wildlife and provides a natural habitat for approximately 250 species of bird, 80 species of mammal &ndash; including black bears, squirrels and chipmunks &ndash; and 24 species of amphibian and reptile. Visitors can stay at lodges and campsites situated around the park and enjoy activities such as hiking, fishing, climbing, horseriding and cross-country skiing.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>The largest urban cultural park in the USA, this 485-hectare (1,200-acre) park is located just north of Downtown San Diego and is a favourite landmark for locals and visitors alike. Local developers set aside the land in the early 1900s and commissioned some of the country's finest architects to create exhibit spaces for the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition celebrating the completion of the Panama Canal. Several buildings with ornate colonial-style architecture, high archways and tiled walkways have been meticulously preserved through the years and house excellent museums. The main street in the park is El Prado, leading past museums, a lily pond and botanical building, and several gardens. Walkways lead from El Prado to the park's other areas, including an outdoor organ pavilion and the San Diego Zoo.  Among the park's 15 museums is the Reuben H Fleet Science Center, with a planetarium, IMAX wide-screen theatre and hands-on science exhibits. Some of the other most celebrated museums include the Automotive Museum (featuring over 80 classic models of car and motorbike), the Museum of Man (exceptional exhibits on anthropology and archaeology), the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum and the Museum of Art (regularly featuring artists from around the world).  Art lovers will find a wide range of topics, artists and mediums to explore throughout the park's many art museums, such as the Museum of Photographic Arts, the Timken Art Gallery and the Mingei International Museum featuring folk art from around the world. The Centro Cultural de la Raza provides resources for Mexican, Chicano and indigenous art and culture.  Other attractions include Japanese Friendship Garden, San Diego Hall of Champions, San Diego Historical Society Museum, San Diego Model Railroad Museum, San Diego Natural History Museum, The Globe Theatres, and the Veteran's Memorial Center Museum.</p>]]></Body>

In the early hours of the morning, from dawn until 0900, the ambitious visitor can get quite another view - that of a busy fish distribution centre. Pier 39, where Beach Street meets The Embarcadero, is actually one of 29 curiously numbered piers on the waterfront and is now the city's biggest attraction. Not only is it home to the sea lions but also the Aquarium of the Bay, where moving sidewalks are surrounded on three sides by water.</p>]]></Body>

Al Capone lodged there, as did birdman Robert Stroud, although his infamy is based more on Hollywood legend than fact - he never did keep birds here. Alcatraz, which imprisoned convicts as much with the Bay estuary's lethal currents as with manmade bars, opened to a curious public in 1973. Now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, its on-island activities include trail walks and audio tours narrated by former inmates and guards. Ferries depart from Pier 33.</p>]]></Body>

Beautiful outdoor murals, often on social justice issues, signal the area as a vital hub of diversity and creative change.

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco's network of century-old cable cars were introduced in 1873 to replace horse-drawn streetcars and refurbished in the 1980s. The ride is best enjoyed from one of the outside platforms but travellers should hold on tight and watch out for traffic. The Powell-Hyde and Powell-Mason lines, beginning at Powell Street and Market Street, run roughly north-south between Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. The California Street line runs east-west from California Street and Market Street, near the Embarcadero to Van Ness Avenue. The cars are turned by hand on turntables at the end of the line - all part of the experience</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>The Guggenheim Museum, a seven-storey spiral building designed by US master architect Frank Lloyd Wright, is worth visiting for the architecture alone. Opened in 1959, its design represented a new way to view art and was a radical departure. Visitors ascend to the top floor via a lift and descend at their own pace on a continuous, circular ramp. The open rotunda makes it possible to see many levels and exhibits simultaneously. The Guggenheim's acclaimed collection consists of late 19th- and 20th-century art works, many of which came from the private collection of Solomon's niece, Peggy Guggenheim.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Started in 1869 and finished by 1886, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi is the exquisite creation of Archbishop Lamy, the city's first archbishop. Created in a French Romanesque style rather than the usual Spanish, it is easily one of the greatest landmarks in New Mexico. The Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary, housing a wooden Virgin that came to Santa Fe in 1625, is all that remains of La Parroquia, the earlier adobe church structure at this site. The cathedral's light stone facade is especially beautiful when it glows in the late afternoon light.</p>]]></Body>

It is usually less crowded and gives a more scenic view of the city's shoreline. There is an excellent observation gallery on the 94th floor, which also has the outside Skywalk. One floor up is the Signature Room, a good spot to sip a cocktail while enjoying the sunset views to the west and the panorama of Lake Michigan to the east. Architecturally, the building is striking because of its massive X-shaped cross-braces.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>The home of Elvis Presley, Graceland is the most famous attraction in Memphis. Elvis purchased the mansion in 1957 and lived there until his death in 1977. His rags to riches story embodies the American Dream and Graceland has plenty to interest the casual visitor as well as the devoted fan. A tour of the mansion includes the gloriously tasteless 'jungle room', with its floor-to-ceiling carpets that Elvis designed himself. In the  Meditation Garden , visitors can see Elvis' grave, which is always covered with bouquets and wreaths, sent by sobbing and adoring fans from all over the world. At Graceland Plaza, opposite the mansion, are a number of exhibitions dedicated to different areas of the singer's life and obsessions. These include an  Automobile Museum , containing his famous pink Cadillac.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Historically the centre for black music and culture in the city, Beale Street is still the musical heart of Memphis and worth visiting just for its atmosphere. It is known as the birthplace of the blues, because it was here that W C Handy wrote  Memphis Blues , so marking the very first time a blues tune had been put onto paper. His house is now a museum, the  W C Handy House Museum , filled with photographs, memorabilia and some of the original sheet music written by the man who popularised blues. Beale Street is still the best place in the city for fans to hear live music, with bars such as  B B King's Blues Club . It is also the location of  A Schwab , the oldest shop in the city, which has been run by the Schwab family since 1876. The general store sells everything from size 74 men's trousers to various voodoo potions.</p>]]></Body>

Sun Studio looks much as it did in the 1950s and contains musical memorabilia, such as a microphone used by Elvis. The tour includes outtakes of recordings made there by the King and other Sun artists, such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. It is still a working studio and artists like Billy Bob Thornton, the Judds, Maroon 5 and Vertical Horizon have recently made recordings here. The adjacent Sun Studio cafe has an old-fashioned fountain where sodas and milkshakes are served.</p>]]></Body>

											<General>
												<Body><![CDATA[<p>This museum tells the story of Memphis music and how it influenced various genres. It explains how rock 'n' roll (and later soul) grew out of the blues, gospel and country music of poor rural sharecroppers from Mississippi. The collection includes early films of Elvis and memorabilia such as Ike Turner's piano and Carl Perkins' guitar. CD players are distributed to each visitor, so they can listen in on the songs related to each exhibit. These range from scratchy recordings of old blues numbers to famous songs from Memphis' Stax Records, including  Dock of the Bay  and the theme from  Shaft . The museum no longer shares the same building as the Gibson Guitar Factory, the manufacturing base for the world-famous guitars, but has moved to the plaza of the FedExForum in the Beale Street Entertainment District.</p>]]></Body>

The handsome Greek revival mansions are still private residences and are not open to the public. One of the grandest homes is the Robinson House, 1415 Third Street, which resembles an Italian villa and was possibly the first house in the city to have indoor plumbing.

Construction began on the oval tabernacle, designed by Brigham Young himself, in 1863 and the crowning glory is the massive domed roof rising 20m (65ft) high and self-supporting, so there are no pillars to block the congregation's views. It still ranks among the largest timber-roof frames in the world. Equally impressive is the tabernacle's simple, unadorned interior and its superb acoustics. The building is home to the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir and a stunning 11,000-pipe organ, both of which can be heard during regular free recitals. The choir sings here every Sunday and holds a practice each Thursday evening that&rsquo;s open to the public at no charge.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>The first Mormons called their land &lsquo;Deseret', which means &lsquo;honeybee'. It&rsquo;s a symbol of industriousness that survives here to this day - the beehive is still Utah's state emblem. Meanwhile, the Beehive House was built in 1854 as the home of LDS leader and territorial governor, Brigham Young. This simple, white house, with its smart green shutters and long verandas, was then the finest in the city. Meticulously restored with period furnishings, artefacts and antiques, it houses a small museum concerning Young's life. The ornate reception room is the highlight of the free guided tours that run every 10 minutes. As Young had over 50 wives and many children, the Lion House next door was built in 1855 to provide additional space for his growing family.</p>]]></Body>

It is built on the site where, in 1531, the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared three times in the guise of an Indian princess to Indian Juan Diego, leaving her image miraculously emblazoned on his cloak. The original basilica was built in 1709. When a large crack appeared and it began to sink into the swampy subsoil, a new basilica was constructed in the same plaza and consecrated in 1976. Juan Diego's cloak has been preserved and hangs behind the main altar. Throughout the year, pilgrims come from all over Mexico to visit. For the D&iacute;a de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guadalupe (Patron Saint's Day), on 12 December, millions throng to pray and give thanks to the dark-skinned virgin. Some worshippers hobble on their knees to the church, while others dance their prayers in traditional Indian costumes with feather head-dresses and skirts in a festive atmosphere.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Officially known as the Plaza de la Constituci&oacute;n, the Z&oacute;calo is Mexico's political, religious and geographical core. It is animated, crowded and alive during daylight hours, yet eerily quiet after dark. The Z&oacute;calo is the venue of choice for a wide range of events, including official ceremonies, city celebrations, demonstrations, rallies and impromptu performances. Twice-daily, a ceremonial flag raising and lowering (at 0600 and 1800) are staged with clock-setting punctuality. On the north side of the Z&oacute;calo is the Catedral Metropolitana. Built in 1573, consecrated in 1667, and completed in 1813 in a baroque style known as churrigueresque, it is the largest and oldest cathedral in Latin America. Next to the cathedral, the ruins of the Templo Mayor of Aztec Tenochtitl&aacute;n gather crowds of onlookers on a daily basis. On the east side of the Z&oacute;calo is the Palacio Nacional, built on the site of an Aztec palace, while a few blocks west is the early 20th-century Museo Nacional de Arte, a fine Italian Renaissance style palace which houses an exhaustive collection of Mexican art from every school and style.</p>]]></Body>

Each time one was completed a new temple was immediately started, using the prior one as a base to showcase the increasing importance of the city.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Now absorbed by Mexico City, the suburb of Coyoac&aacute;n was once a city in its own right. It became the first capital of New Spain as Cort&eacute;s designated it the main camp from which he launched his attack on Tenochtitl&aacute;n. Tranquil tree-lined avenues link the handsome colonial-era buildings and strings of craft stalls. Jugglers, street musicians and mime artists converge on the central squares of Plaza Hidalgo and Jard&iacute;n del Centenario at weekends and lend a bohemian vibe. Artist Frida Kahlo was born in Coyac&aacute;n in 1907 and the Museo Casa de Frida Kahlo, Londres 247 (corner of Allende), occupies her family home. Kahlo and her husband, the revolutionary muralist Diego Rivera, lived here from 1929 and formed part of Mexico City's glamorous, leftist, 1930s intellectual set. Today the house is full of mementoes from this era with two rooms preserved as lived in and the rest crammed with paintings by both artists. A small collection of folk art - a passion of Kahlo's - includes a number of regional costumes worn by the artist, who continued to live in the property until her death.</p>]]></Body>

Huge collections span vast themes in a giant building centred on an expansive patio. Though housed in an extension of Chapultepec Park, it can take days to fully explore. Some of the most fascinating exhibits are the famous Aztec 'sun' (or 'calendar') stones, the giant stone Olmec heads from Tabasco and a replica of a Mayan tomb from Palenque. Daily performances staged outside of the museum's main entrance are publicised by voladores (fliers) - most re-enact ancient ceremonies in colourful, traditional costumes and perform daring aerial acrobatics &ndash; known as dances &ndash; while suspended upside down from the top of a 30 meter (99 ft.) pole.</p>]]></Body>

On Chapultepec Hill is the Castillo de Chapultepec, which was built in 1785 for the Spanish viceroys and used as a residence for Mexico's presidents until 1940. It is the home of the Museo Nacional de Historia (National History Museum). A miniature train climbs the hill from inside the entrance to Chapultepec Park. Today the park attracts thousands of visitors, especially on Sundays when families come to relax and picnic. Attractions are split into a trio of distinct areas with the primera secci&oacute;n (first section), on Paseo de la Reforma; the segunda secci&oacute;n (second section) occupied by La Feria (Amusement Park), and the tercera secci&oacute;n (third section) by Atlantis, a marine park with dolphin and seal shows and an aquarium.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Dubbed the Champs Elys&eacute;es because of its Parisian-style architectural influences, the Paseo de la Reforma is Mexico City's main boulevard and most prestigious address. Running from Alameda to Chapultepec Park, it is lined with shops, offices, hotels, restaurants and some modern skyscrapers that are home to multinational corporations, financial institutions and foreign embassies. Monuments, fountains and statues of Mexican heroes also hem the route, built as a direct path for the Emperor Maximilian between the Centro Hist&oacute;rico and his palace in Chapultepec Park. Particularly worthy of note is Monumento a la Independencia (Monument to Independence), or Angelito as it is affectionately known, a gilded statue of a winged Victory set atop a 46m-high (150ft) column. In 1957, the statue toppled to the ground in an earthquake, but was completely restored. Displayed inside the monument is the skull of Hidalgo, the executed leader of a group of rebels who rose against the Spanish in October 1810 (open daily 0900-1700, free).</p>]]></Body>

Today, it has a small exhibit about two-time Costa Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Oscar Arias, and you&rsquo;ll need to knock on the door to see it. It&rsquo;s too bad, because Costa Rica&rsquo;s notably peaceful history, in a region regularly rocked by violence, is worth further study. Here, at least, you&rsquo;ll learn about the 1988 Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which helped end decades of violent conflict in Central America. </p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>San Jos&eacute;, an impoverished agrarian village during the height of the Spanish colonial period, lacks the grandiose Catholic churches boasted by other Latin American capitals. It&rsquo;s still worth stopping by the simple but harmonious 1871 Metropolitan Cathedral, overlooking San Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s original Central Park. The fa&ccedil;ade is pretty enough, but step inside &ndash; the Moorish tiles, fine stained glass, and ornamentation all seem to echo the rainforest. A sculpture in the gardens commemorates Pope John Paul II&rsquo;s visit. </p>]]></Body>

Exhibits focus on the anthropology and archaeology of each of Panama's regions, and are highlighted by rare artefacts from around the country. The exhibition includes pre-Columbian gold and jewellery, thousands of ceramics and stone figures. There is also a reconstruction of a tomb excavation with skeletal remains. It&rsquo;s a good museum to check out if you plan on visiting the Parque Natural Metropolitano.</p>]]></Body>

There has, however, been a soft opening and it's now possible to visit on weekends. The museum focuses on the incredible biodiversity found within Panama's ecosystems, and is housed in a unique building designed by the much acclaimed architect himself. This is Gehry's only building in Latin America and there are various galleries within that celebrate Panama as the essential bridge between the Americas, as well as its astonishing wildlife. There's also the biopark, bringing together highlights from Panama's diverse natural world. But the star is the building itself, a mind-boggling clutter of colourful pavilions and amorphous shapes designed to blend in with Panama's tropical environment. It's Gehry's finest work since the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.</p>]]></Body>

The economic lifeline of the country, it is of enormous historical importance, too. Having been built by the US more than a century ago, it provides a crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and controversially remained under American control until 1999. Since the handover, the canal has brought more income than ever before to Panama and been the powerhouse behind its rapid development in recent years. Most visitors choose to visit the Miraflores Locks, which are located next the visitors' centre, an open-air restaurant, a museum and a viewing platform.</p>]]></Body>

It&rsquo;s a lovely break from the urban craziness of Panama City, helped by the fact that it&rsquo;s a pedestrian island.

The falls are made up of two separate parts, Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side and American Falls  on the USA side. Although not the highest waterfall in the world they move a staggering 168,000 cubic metres (219,600 cubic yards) of water per minute over a drop of 51m (167ft), making them one of the natural wonders of the world. The city of Niagara Falls itself is stuffed with wax museums and theme restaurants, but just to the north lies the storybook village of Niagara-on-the-Lake. Southwest of the falls, the north shore of Lake Erie is dotted with small resorts and good beaches; Port Stanley is particularly popular.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Established in 1972, Kluane National Park and Reserve has been the home of the Southern Tutchone First Nations people for thousands of years. The park is a vast expanse of mountains and ice and encompasses the Icefield Ranges; the highest mountain in this range, Mount Logan, rises to 5959 metres (19,545 ft) and is the highest peak in Canada. Other popular activities on offer in the park include cross country skiing, boating, fishing, snowmobiling, cycling, mountainbiking and horseriding. A rafting trip down the Alsek River allows visitors to view the wildlife (including grizzly bears, Dall sheep and golden eagles) and glaciers along the way; however, permits for rafting on this Canadian Heritage river are strictly limited to one departure per day and visitors are advised to arrange their trip well in advance.</p>]]></Body>

It's filled with street entertainers and visitors milling around visiting the popular Kiosk Frontenac booth or promenading past cannons that predate Château Frontenac. Nearby, the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville is dominated by the Basilique-Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Québec, the city's main Catholic cathedral.</p>]]></Body>

Located in the historic Hazeur and Smith houses, the Musée de la place Royale has exhibits illustrating the area's history, while the historic Maison Chevalier recreates domestic scenes from the 17th century.

On the heights of Cap Diamant, the star-shaped fortress was built to withstand attacks on the city from across the Plains of Abraham to the southwest. Nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Americas', visitors can see inside as part of a one-hour guided tour. A visit to the Musée Royal 22e Régiment is included, showcasing the history of the Van Doos, Canada's only Francophone armed forces unit. The Changing of the Guard takes place each summer morning at 1000 with the Regimental Band and Batisse, the Citadel mascot and regimental goat. The pomp continues on selected evenings, when the Van Doos perform 'The Retreat' as part of the flag-lowering ceremonies.</p>]]></Body>

An historic exhibit on the ramparts' construction can be found at the Interpretation Centre, located at Porte St-Louis (one of the four surviving city gates). Clockwise from the centre, the walls adjoin Artillery Park, which was built by the French to defend the city before becoming a garrison for British officers until 1871, when it was turned into a munitions factory. Tours to the Arsenal Foundry, the officers' barracks, and the Dauphine Redoubt are also offered at the park.</p>]]></Body>

It was the site of the decisive battle of 1759, when the British, led by General Wolfe, defeated General Montcalm's French forces. Today, it's a wide green space with a classic French garden, popular for summer concerts and outdoor activities. For those with a taste for history, the Discovery Pavilion (in the same building as the tourist office) has a large diorama of the site and the Odyssey historical multimedia exhibition. Midway through the park, Martello Tower No 1 has costumed guides who explain the role of these defensive structures (summer only). Abraham's Bus connects the sites, with the driver providing commentary as it winds through the park daily from late June until mid-September.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Since it was established in 1860, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has been at the forefront of promoting Canadian and international art. The permanent collection is split between the original beaux-arts building, which houses Canadian, Inuit and First Nations art, as well as decorative arts; and the postmodern structure opposite where European masters, prints and drawings and decorative arts are exhibited. In the tunnel connecting the pavilions are galleries showcasing contemporary Canadian artists and a small collection from ancient cultures. </p>
<p>In 2000, the museum received the Liliane and David M Stewart Collection as a gift, comprising some 5,000 items of decorative art dating from the end of the 1930s onwards. The whole collection of the former Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts, one of the most important in North America, thus entered the museum. The museum also has a reputation for hosting outstanding temporary exhibitions. </p>]]></Body>

The Tivoli Boys Guard Band parade through the gardens at 1730 and 1930 on weekends and public holidays, with a full orchestra.

Of special interest is the 10m (32ft)-high pulpit, which took sculptor Albert Jansz Vinckenbrinck almost 20 years to create. Located next door to the Royal Palace, the Nieuwe Kerk has been used for the inauguration of Dutch monarchs since 1815 (Queen Beatrix was crowned here in 1980, and King Willem-Alexander&rsquo;s wedding to M&aacute;xima Zorriguieta Cerruti took place here in 2002).

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Despite the city&rsquo;s wealth of art and culture, Amsterdam&rsquo;s leading attraction remains its prostitution zone, where skimpily clad sex-service workers solicit customers from the windows of their street-level rooms. Crowds file through a series of narrow alleys to gawk (snapshots will be severely chastised), and services are offered round the clock by a global rainbow of girls occupying nearly 300 red-lit windows. If you can get beyond the sleaze, this is actually one of the loveliest and most ancient sections of the canal ring, revolving around Amsterdam&rsquo;s oldest church. The Red Light Secrets (Oudezijds Achterburgwal 60), takes a frank look at the sex trade and invites visitors to step into the high-heels of a sex-service worker.</p>]]></Body>

The new wing, with its bathtub-like roof, stands alongside Museumplein in marked contrast to the stately red-brick original, providing a great deal more space for larger-scale pieces. Its airy foyer, bookstore-cum-gift shop and lively restaurant are welcome additions to the complex. Halls are arranged by movements such as pop art, intermedia and nouveau realism, exemplified by the works of such stalwarts as Warhol, De Kooning and Rauschenberg, while temporary exhibitions are just as likely to focus on fashion design or photography as painting and sculpture.</p>]]></Body>

Located in the Spaarndammerbuurt neighbourhood, immediately north of Westerpark, it houses a small museum and makes a good jumping-off point for a tour of the style. The building was designed by one of its pioneers, Michel de Klerk, as low-income housing and its undulating brick facade and fanciful dunce cap of a tower amply demonstrate his feverish imagination. Hourly tours focus on the development of the Amsterdam School with a visit to one of the building&rsquo;s apartments. The nearby annex and caf&eacute; holds a display of street fixtures, all stylised by designers from the movement.</p>]]></Body>

The main exhibit relates Holland&rsquo;s centuries-old navigation history through paintings, seagoing artefacts and an ongoing interactive visual display, featuring the sorts of characters who populated the industry in the Golden Age. For ship buffs, one floor is given over to a stunning collection of model schooners. The highlight of a visit, though, has to be the zealously preserved replica of the Dutch East India&rsquo;s Company&rsquo;s Amsterdam floating in the quay outside (the actual ship vanished at sea in 1749). Another exhibit, on the Dutch whaling industry, is designed with young visitors in mind.</p>]]></Body>

Its European Art Gallery is an absolute treasure, containing many rarely seen masterworks. Highlights include Von Eyck's Crucifixion and a Rembrandt. On every Tuesday, the museum also opens the former royal living quarters to visitors. Guided tours in English can be organised in advance by contacting the museum.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Down an unassuming boulevard in the wealthy Dorobanti district of Bucharest, Palatul Primaverii (Spring Palace) is the former home of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena, who lived there for the last 25 years of their lives, before their execution in 1989. Opened to the public in March 2016, the house shows the opulent surroundings the couple lived in while much of the country subsisted on rations. Carpets given by the last Shah of Iran, paintings taken from the country&rsquo;s former royal palaces, and rooms done up in the style of Versailles hardly attest to a couple in touch with the lives of the common man. The palace remains largely untouched since the 1989 revolution, even down to the couple&rsquo;s wardrobes and pyjamas lying on their bed, enabling visitors to get a real glimpse into the lives of the former first couple.</p>]]></Body>

Much of the area has been renovated and now packed with trendy coffee houses and restaurants - most lively when they spill onto the cobbled streets (or overtake empty lots) during summer. At its heart is the 15th-century Curtea Veche (Old Court), attributed to Vlad Tepes, which contains a few walls, arches, tombstones and one restored Corinthian column. Not far from there is the lovely Stavropoleos Church with painted frescoes and an ornately carved iconostasis.</p>]]></Body>

A fabulous fresco of the blessed and the damned, ascending to heaven or tumbling into hell, adorns the entrance, as well as the oldest icon on the site, depicting patron saints Constantin and Helen (1665). Inside, expressive and beautifully painted icons, embedded in an exquisite gilded altarpiece, dazzle the eye in the sombre darkness. St Dumitru, Bucharest's patron saint, lies entombed in the left-hand corner and worshippers constantly climb the small staircase to his shrine to pay their respects.</p>]]></Body>

Discovered in 1959, the cave is the third largest gypsum cave in the world and parts of the complex are only accessible via large wells. The huge caves have been given names such as Cinderella's Hall and Dacia's Hall reflecting their size and grandeur and there are also several underground lakes including the Blue Lake and the Dinosaur Lake.

An unfeasibly large water feature dominates the centre of the square. Dubbed the Statue of Brabo and the Giant&rsquo;s Hand, it was erected in 1887 and depicts the legend of Antwerp&rsquo;s creation.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Considered by UNESCO to be one of the world's foremost showcases of the  Middle Ages, Bryggen consists of a series of gabled buildings situated  on the old wharf of Bergen. It stands as a reminder of Bergen's  prominent role in the days of the Hanseatic League, an organisation  founded by a group of northern German towns to protect their mutual  trading interests in the 13th to 15th centuries. The buildings were  mainly used as warehouses for the dried fish trade, but also contained  offices and simple living quarters for merchants, journeymen and  apprentices.</p>
<p>
<p>Today, Bryggen is alive with restaurants, caf&eacute;s and artists' workshops, and a colourful attraction at the eastern end is Torget, a weekday market selling fruit and vegetables, handicrafts and souvenirs. and Saturday 0700-1500. Slightly reduced hours operate outside the peak season.</p>]]></Body>

Law courts, temples and public offices were all based in this area, where ordinary Athenians, stallholders and merchants mingled with officials, politicians and philosophers. Today, the site is dominated by the 5th-century BC Hephaisteion (Temple of Haephaistos), one of Greece&rsquo;s best-preserved ancient temples. The fascinating Mouse&iacute;o tis Agoras (Museum of Agor&aacute;) contains an eccentric array of everyday artefacts found in the area. It is housed in the second-century BC Stoa Attalou (Stoa of Attalos), which is thought to have been an early shopping arcade containing 42 separate shops.</p>]]></Body>

									<General>
										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The show-stopping Acropolis (upper city) dominates both the city's skyline and any tourist's itinerary. Athens&rsquo; original settlement was founded on this rocky outcrop and it has seen modifications through the millennia. The site includes four sacred buildings, all from the Golden Age of Pericles (461-429BC). The steep ascent to the summit leads to the Propylaea, a monumental entrance to the site in Ionic and Doric styles. The Temple of Athena Nike is to the left of the Propylaea; the original was damaged by Turkish forces in the 17th century but has been beautifully restored. The Parthenon is the largest building on the Acropolis and an icon of Western civilisation. Built entirely from marble, it was intended as a sanctuary for the goddess Athena and housed a massive statue of her, long since lost to history. Despite the tourists, the perfect harmony of the structure is still awe-inspiring. The Erechtheion temple is a dual shrine to Athena and Poseidon-Erechtheus and was built on the site of the mythical battle between the two deities. The south side features a series of six support columns designed as maidens or caryatids.</p>]]></Body>

Situated near the village of Zurrieq in southwestern Malta, which is famous for its rocky coastline, the waters around the limestone caves and archways are said to be at their most impressive in the early morning when the sun's rays glimmer through the opening to the grotto. The cave, which is known as Il-Hnejja, meaning 'The Arch', in Maltese, was given its English name by British soldiers who thought that its blue waters resembled the Grotta Azzurra  (Blue Grotto) in Capri. To get to the grotto, visitors travel by boat, passing under a massive arch, deep into the 43-metre (140-ft) high cave which is hollowed out of the cliff rockface.</p>]]></Body>

Commanding the peninsula that divides Malta's two harbours, the fort dates back to the 16th century when a watchtower existed on the site.

After the war, it played an important role in the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt during the Suez crisis in 1956 and during the Cuban Missile Crises of 1962. Five years later, it was taken over by NATO as a strategic Communication Centre for the interception of Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean.

A visit to this opulent baroque and rococo masterpiece is a must. Located 79km (49 miles) south of Riga, Rundāle Palace and Museum nestles near the town of Bauska. Built as a summer residence for the Duke of Courland Ernst Johann Biron by the Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, the opulent palace was completed in 1768. The palace was given to the Republic of Latvia in 1920 as a part of agrarian reform. It was in a rundown state back then, but a lengthy restoration completed in 2014 has returned much of Rundāle Palace to its former grandeur. Featuring the White Hall, the Great Gallery and the Duchess&rsquo;s rooms, Rundāle displays the magnificent work of German sculptors and Italian painters.</p>]]></Body>

But Riga is particularly renowned for its art nouveau structures, which many believe form the finest collection of this architectural style anywhere in Europe. The style (Jugendstil &ndash; the German-style art nouveau) is unmistakable, with ornate stucco swirls adorning doorways, human faces embellishing facades and outlandish towers growing from the tops of buildings. The best way for visitors to appreciate this architectural treasure-trove is to wander through the downtown area, staring upwards. One of the best examples of Jugendstil is on and around Elizabetes iela, where many of the buildings are laden with all the tell-tale flourishes of this lavish architectural style.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Just outside the Old Town walls, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Riga has been reincarnated many times. St Jacob&rsquo;s Cathedral (Jēkaba Katedrāle) was once a Lutheran parish church, a Jesuit church and even a Swedish garrison church. But now, revelling in layers of history, it is an atmospheric place of Catholic worship. The Church of Jesus (Jēzus Baznīca), Riga's oldest wooden church, has fought an epic battle with fire for centuries. Its survival alone is reason enough to visit. Grebenstchikov Church is another wooden structure, a gold-domed affair dating back to the early 19th century. Alexander Nevsky Church (Aleksandra Nevska Baznīca) is a Russian Orthodox structure dating back to the 1820s. Named after the 13th-century Russian prince celebrated by Riga&rsquo;s Russian population as a folk hero, the church is bright yellow and hard to miss.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The voluminous Freedom Monument, fondly known as 'Milda', occupies a sacred place in the hearts and minds of every Latvian. In 1935, private donations paid for and erected this potent symbol of the nation, which somehow survived four decades of Soviet rule. During the Communist era, locals often joked that the monument was really a travel agent, since laying flowers at the site guaranteed a one-way ticket to Siberia. Today, the monument is back to its best after a major renovation and still retains its poignancy, doubling as a favourite meeting point for the city's youth.</p>]]></Body>

With its iconic skyline of 15th- and 16th-century churches and palaces, this walled fortress was actually founded in 1147. Its golden era was from 1276 to 1712, as the seat of the grand princes and tsars of Russia, though its place in popular culture was assured by its role as the headquarters of the government of the Soviet Union.

<p>When Sofia was conquered by the Turks in 1382, this building became a<em>konak</em> (headquarters) of the local Ottoman administrators. At one time these were used to interrogate Bulgarian rebels. These days it charts the development of Bulgarian art from 1878 to the mid-20th century, beginning with the Revivalist period and portraiture with painters like Zograf, Dospevski and Pavlovic. Moving into the early 20th century, examples of the popular 1930s movement includes scenes by Nikola Tanev, a Gaugin-esque Stoyan Sotinov and wonderful paintings of old Plovdiv by Tzanko Lavrenov.  There are also regularly changing exhibitions from international artists.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Opened in 2011, this new addition to Sofia&rsquo;s cultural scene boasts a fascinating collection of Socialist sculpture, paintings and other art. The main spectacle is the outdoor sculpture park, where visitors are greeted by the vast statue of Lenin that once stood in the centre of the city. The red star taken from the top of the Socialist Party headquarters is also here as well as over 70 other relics that are inexorably linked to Bulgaria&rsquo;s past. Uplifting and melancholy in turn, the most frustrating part of the museum is that it lacks a sign. Look for the statues in the garden instead.</p>]]></Body>

The tiny medieval church was closed to the public for 38 years while it underwent restoration work, finally reopening in 2000. It is best known for its exquisite 13th-century frescoes, depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. These are renowned for their realism and considered among the best examples of the Bulgaria's medieval art. Boyana is one of ten Bulgarian cultural monuments included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites (seven of which are cultural sites, three natural). In fact, it&rsquo;s so hallowed that admission is restricted to 10 minutes in the company of a guide. Accessed by minibus 21 from Boulevard Patriarh Evtimly.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>During the years of Ottoman occupation there were 70 mosques in Sofia, but today there is only one still functioning. Banya Bashi Mosque was built in 1576 by Mimar Sinan, who also built the Sultan Selim Mosque in Edirne and Istanbul's famous Blue Mosque. The mosque&rsquo;s finest feature is its domed ceiling, restored to its original design after the fall of Communism. Loudspeakers call the city's Muslim minority to prayer five times a day: on Friday there can be as many as 400 worshippers in attendance. The mosque is not officially open as a tourist attraction but visitors are welcome outside prayer times, including women, just be sure to dress respectfully.</p>
<p>The inside is decorated with fine blue tiles and calligraphy, citing texts from the Koran, as the portrayal of human figures is banned in Islamic art. Known as Banya Bashi, meaning &lsquo;many baths', outside the mosque there are the small remains of the original <em>hammam </em>(Turkish baths), unearthed in 2003-2004.</p>]]></Body>

It's around this point you&rsquo;ll probably consider the entrance fee money badly spent, but don&rsquo;t give up. Ethnography is the study of different cultures and how they behave and evolve, and in this sense the museum mirrors its aims completely. After starting with the building blocks of Bulgarian rural life, things progress into an exhibition about the town of Yugavo in the Rhodope Mountains. It includes some beautiful black and white pictures from the village including men in fezzes and straight-backed woman, all with darkened skin from a lifetime in the fields. In the next rooms you will see a different kind of building block: looms and knitting needles the size of pneumatic drills. There are also children&rsquo;s toys and dolls that would not out of place in a horror film today. Certainly one of the city&rsquo;s less trumpeted attractions, it&rsquo;s without doubt one of its most charming.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Probably Sofia's most photographed monument, Alexandar Nevski is a magnificent neo-Byzantine cathedral-sized church, topped by copper and golden domes and one of the largest Eastern Orthodox churches in the world. Built between 1882 and 1912, the church takes its name from Alexandar Nevski, credited with saving Russia from Swedish troops in 1240, and the patron saint of the family of the tsar at that time, Alexander II (also known as Tsar Osvoboditel, the &lsquo;Tsar Liberator') who led the army that drove out the Turks. The inside is even more impressive; a darkened interior with vast domes covered with delicate murals. The central altar is dedicated to St Alexandar Nevski, the southern altar to St Boris (who brought Christianity to Bulgaria) and the northern altar to Saints Cyril and Methodius (who created the Cyrillic alphabet). The Icon Museum, located in the crypt, has over 300 icons and mural frescoes tracing the development of Bulgarian icon-painting from the late ninth century up to the end of the 19th century.</p>]]></Body>

The impressive cupola bears a 14th-century portrait of Christ the Pantocrator, surrounded by four angels and symbols of the Evangelists. Beneath, 12th-century fresco work depicts 22 prophets holding scrolls, with texts alternately in Bulgarian and Greek.

However, neither the Tsars nor the crusaders proved as lethal to the locals as the Nazis and the Soviets who followed. As a result, the dark days of both occupations have been given their own museum, which brings those years chillingly back to life.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The unflatteringly named Paks Margareeta (Fat Margaret) might, if you squint, resemble a seated full-figured lady, but this tower's real purpose was considerably less benign than the name suggests. Part of a network of defensive structures facing out over the sea towards Finland, Paks Margareeta was built in the early 16th century and got its name, depending on who you listen to, from a large cannon or a chubby cook who worked there. Today, it houses the Estonian Maritime Museum that charts the history of Estonia's lengthy sea-faring past. Not that it is all navy cannons and elaborate ships' prows - one of the most touching exhibits is a set of Neolithic fishing gear.</p>]]></Body>

Dotted with towering fir trees, it houses the earthly remains of some of the country's most famous names, among them writer Eduard Vilde and Estonia's first president, Konstantin Pats. Established in 1933, it nevertheless has a slightly Gothic feel thanks to the odd tumbledown gravestone and the overarching firs. Other big name inhabitants worth looking out for as you wander its shady paths include poet Lydia Koidula, writer Anton-Hansen Tammsaare and chess champion Paul Keres.</p>]]></Body>

Instead, the former defensive tower, which was given its nickname thanks to its loftiness (enabling soldiers living there to peer into the kitchens of the Old Town houses below), is packed with military artefacts as well as a top-floor caf&eacute; and an art gallery. Beneath it is a network of defensive tunnels that extend out into Toompea Hill below. Since being built in the 1470s, the tower has been called into action on numerous occasions, not least during Ivan the Terrible&rsquo;s assault in the late 1500s.</p>]]></Body>

The cathedral played an integral role in the Protestant Reformation, and the movement's legacy accounts for the relatively unostentatious interior. Recent archaeological discoveries suggest the existence of a Roman cemetery underneath the church. There are also remains of a Romanesque cloister, 12th-century statuary and a stained glass work in the choir by Augusto Giacometti (Alberto's cousin). The Karlsturm tower has 187 steps; there is no lift.</p>]]></Body>

The museum is housed within two buildings dating from the 1850s, both of which are set within the centrally located Rieterpark. The Villa Wesendonck has special exhibitions in addition to its collection of Indian, Chinese and African art (the core of which is the sculpture collection donated by Baron Eduard von der Heydt), while the Park-Villa Rieter has a diverse display of paintings from China, Japan and India. The latter also holds occasional world music concerts.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This quirky little museum houses a colourful assortment of toys from the 18th to 20th centuries, but should be seen as far more than just a collection of playthings. The exhibits, ranging from railway sets and dolls to tin figurines and board games, give valuable insight into the fashions, domestic life and industry of the periods during which they were created, while a series of special exhibitions unearth additional treasures to complement the permanent collection. The venue&rsquo;s location in the heart of the Old Town gives it a suitably historical feel. Opening hours are limited though, so time your visit in advance.</p>]]></Body>

The current church dates from the 13th century, although the undercroft contains the original abbey crypt. The elegant spire dates from 1732, although the rest of the church is predominantly gothic. The site was originally endowed by Charlemagne's grandson, and later became the church of the Zurich Noblewomen's Convent.

Its peak is easily accessible by train from Zurich main station, on Europe&rsquo;s steepest normal-gauge railway, but more energetic visitors may prefer to make the hour&rsquo;s walk up to the summit. The mountain offers impressive views of the city and Lake Zurich, and there are plenty of outdoor activities available too, including mountain biking, paragliding and hiking as well as sledding in winter. In spring, the mountain blooms with wild flowers, while in autumn the summit rises above the fog that often blankets the city below.

The city&rsquo;s <em>jet d'eau</em> is in many ways its Eiffel Tower, providing an iconic backdrop for many a tourist's holiday snap. Dominating the harbour, it spurts out 500 litres of water, some 140m (459ft) into the air, every second. Far from being intended as a tourist attraction, the jet was initially a pressure release valve for Geneva&rsquo;s water supply. The aquatic showpiece is illuminated at night and adds an impressive dimension to the city's annual fireworks display in August. During the day the fountain takes care of the special effects for itself, with the appearance of shimmering rainbows a common spectacle during sunny periods.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>For a spot so central to Geneva&rsquo;s religious life, St Peter's Cathedral &ndash; built between 1160 and 1289 &ndash; is surprisingly small. Even more astonishing is its combination of Romanesque, gothic, and neoclassical styles. The austerity of the main body of the church seems wholly appropriate for a building in which protestant reformer John Calvin preached (1536-1564). By contrast, the 15th-century Chapel of the Maccabees (restored in 1875) is a riot of gilded embellishment against blue and red backgrounds. The neoclassical facade was added in 1750.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This little artisan town, just 2km (1 mile) south of Geneva&rsquo;s city centre, is full of book and antique restorers, glass blowers, watchmakers, clothes designers, hatters, trendy bistros and smart restaurants. In 1772, the people of Turin came to set up a town to rival Geneva. Carouge changed hands frequently but, in 1816, the town was annexed to Geneva and became Swiss. Its architecture therefore remains Italianate in style and the narrow streets are straight and orderly, with apartments looking onto wide, green courtyards. Populated by Geneva's bohemians, Carouge makes for an interesting alternative to the slick city centre.</p>]]></Body>

It's most famous for being where Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the world wide web, and for its Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, which sends particles racing round a 27km (16 miles) underground ring. Visitors can see the awe-inspiring LHR for themselves on a guided tour, while CERN's outreach building, a 27m high illuminated sphere called The Globe of Science and Innovation, hosts a permanent exhibition helping you get your head around particle physics. Children should at least be 13 years old. A bit of preperation ahead of the visit is helpful to understand the explanations you will hear at CERN.</p>]]></Body>

								<Content>
									<General>
										<Body><![CDATA[<p>About 1.5km (1 mile) offshore from Etel&auml;satama harbour, the sea fortress of Suomenlinna was once the bastion of the Swedish empire, with a larger population than Helsinki itself. Founded in 1748 to protect the coast from Russian attack, the fortress island was finally surrendered to Russia in 1808. This superb fortification was one of the main reasons why the Russians moved the capital from Turku to Helsinki in 1812. Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, the fortress buildings contain the Suomenlinna Museum, the Ehrensv&auml;rd Museum, the multimedia Suomenlinna Experience, the Suomenlinna Toy Museum, the Military Museum's Manege, the Customs Museum and the WWI-era Submarine Vesikko, amongst other attractions, restaurants and bars. Despite the looming cannons, the rest of the island is a peaceful green haven, and locals flock here for summer picnics. During the summer months, there are daily guided tours around Suomenlinna in English, Swedish and Finnish. In the winter there are tours in English during the weekends. Helsinki City Transport runs regular ferries to Suomenlinna from Kauppatori (free with a Helsinki Card, journey time - 15 minutes). JT-Lines runs a waterbus service on the same route from May to mid-September.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The construction of Prague's most famous and photographed location began in 1357, as part of Charles IV's monumental building programme. The bridge replaced the earlier Judita Bridge, a remnant of which is the plainer of the two towers on the Mal&aacute; Strana gate. The bridge itself is rather drab and it is the later statues (Jesuit additions during the Counter-Reformation), which flank the crossing, that have made it so visually stunning. The first of these (the Crucifixion) was erected in 1657, the latest not until 1928. Fully pedestrianised, this bridge is a tourist focal point, and a sunset stroll here over the rolling Vltava is one of Prague&rsquo;s quintessential experiences.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The 12th-century Old Town Square is another focal point for tourists in Prague. In summer, tables spill out from the restaurants, while in December the square hosts the city's largest Christmas Market. All of the palaces, churches and houses around the square are of major historical interest, such as the gothic Staromestsk&aacute; Radnice (Old Town Hall). Its Astronomical Clock has become a must for visitors, although the spectacle doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to its billing. It strikes hourly from 0900-2100, when the 15th-century upper portion reveals the Apostles at two windows. Expect large crowds in summer. Just off the square, to the east, is the superb gothic Chr&aacute;m Matky Bož&iacute; Před T&yacute;nem (Tyn Church), where the tomb of the astronomer Tycho Brahe is found.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The pinnacle of art nouveau architecture in Prague, Obecn&iacute; D&ugrave;m has been fully restored to the glory of its original form. It was mainly designed by Antonin Bals&aacute;nek and Osvald Pol&iacute;vka, although a large number of major Czech artists made contributions during its construction. The most spectacular of the public areas is the Lord Mayor's Room, which features murals by Alphonse Mucha. The restaurant, caf&eacute; and the Amerikansk&yacute; bar were also the work of Pol&iacute;vka. The centrepiece of the building is the Smetana Hall, home of the Prague Symphony Orchestra and one of the major venues for concerts during the Prague Spring Festival. Guided tours are essential for visitors looking to get a proper overview.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Despite its name, Wenceslas Square is really a long boulevard. In 1989, it became the focal point for the remarkable demonstrations that led to the Velvet Revolution. Today, the square is a bustling thoroughfare presenting the best and worst of post-Communist Prague - from fashionable stores to a rather seedy nightlife. Nothing remains of the square's earliest buildings, although examples of architectural styles from the last 150 years line its frontage. The lower portion is pedestrianised and contains many of Prague's largest stores. There are numerous arcades with winding passages (developed in the 1920s) and many have now been renovated to their original art deco splendour.</p>]]></Body>

Founded in 1818, it houses the country's oldest and largest collection of antiquities. However, this principal building has been closed for reconstruction since 2011, with work due to be completed in late 2018. Happily, various other sub-components of the museum remain open to visitors. These include a museum of music, a museum of natural history and a museum of Asian, African and American cultures, located in different parts of the city. When the main building reopens on Wenceslas Square, it will once again provide a striking celebration of the history of the former Czechoslovakia.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This intimate museum is devoted exclusively to the work of the renowned art nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha. Czech Republic&rsquo;s answer to Toulouse Lautrec, Mucha is most famous for the posters he designed for theatre productions starring the great fin-de-si&egrave;cle actress Sarah Bernhardt, and much of his work on exhibit here, epitomises the art nouveau aesthetic. It&rsquo;s a relatively small museum, but the collection includes phenomenal paintings, posters, sketches, statues and photographs by the artist, and also features Mucha's lesser-known works celebrating pan-Slavism, as well as a recreation of his Paris studio.

Soaring upwards from the square outside the church is the startling gold statue of the Madonna, with four equally vivid angels at her feet. Inside, on the north wall, note a 12th-century inscription in Glagolitic script (a predecessor to Cyrillic) and a series of 13th-century frescoes. The tomb of Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac is a source of some controversy, as he had been convicted of colluding with the Nazis during the WWII but was later exonerated by Pope John Paul II.</p>]]></Body>

This vast expanse of lush lawns and oak woods was remodelled in 1843 with English-style landscaping that includes artificial lakes, streams, meadows and romantic follies. There is also a small zoo, a very busy caf&eacute; and a football stadium that&rsquo;s the home of Dinamo Zagreb and the Croatian national team. As it&rsquo;s only a short tram ride from the centre, it&rsquo;s a popular summer spot for locals who haven&rsquo;t deserted to the coast.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This romantic footpath offers some of the finest views over Zagreb. The 19th-century promenade was built when the old town walls were torn down, and now allows views of the lower town below as well as the Sava River beyond. Old-fashioned gas lamps illuminate the caf&eacute;s and the trees shadow the benches. Look out for the sculpture of Croatian modernist poet Antun Gustav Mato&scaron;, whose silver figure by Ivan Kožarić reclines nonchalantly on a bench. The most amusing way to reach it is by funicular (from Tomićeva, just off Ilica), although it is also quite feasible to walk up.</p>]]></Body>

									<General>
										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The gaol ("open 360 days a year") is a Gothic, and deceptively romantic, Georgian building designed by Sir Thomas Deane (also responsible for the magnificently decorative Imperial Hotel in South Mall). The audio tour gives a chilling representation of harsh prison life, which kept prisoners isolated and silent. Young children were whipped twice weekly and there was scant regard for pregnant women caught stealing rags for clothing. Public executions were performed here and heads displayed outside to instil fear in the public. Opened in 1824, in later years the gaol housed Republican prisoners including writer Frank O'Connor. It finally closed in 1923. There is also an interesting radio museum attached.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This architectural gem, completed in a Victorian Gothic style, was created by the English architect William Burges. It is famous for its craftsmanship, particularly in the sculpture, marble mosaics and stained glass. The cathedral stands on the site where the city of Cork was founded in the 7th century and is built of local limestone. The interior is made of Bath stone and the walls are lined with red Cork marble. The local names for its spires (whiskey and porter) are testament to the industries that brought prosperity to the city, despite the efforts of Father Mathew, the founder of the Temperance Movement, who preached moderation in alcohol consumption. He is commemorated by a statue in St Patrick's Street.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Santiago&rsquo;s glorious cathedral warms the spirit as soon as you glimpse its majestic baroque facade in mossy granite. This twin-towered city emblem was created by the Santiago-born architect Fernando de Casas y Novoa, who superimposed it on the original Romanesque plan of the basilica. Just inside is the P&oacute;rtico da Gloria, a masterpiece of Romanesque sculpture that once opened onto the square with almost 200 sculptures of Galician granite, dating from 1188.</p>
<p>Look for the finger holes worn into the stone over the years by pilgrims who, giving thanks at the end of their lengthy journey, prayed with the fingers of one hand pressed into the roots of the Tree of Jesse, below St James. From here, the great nave opens towards the chancel and the monumental baroque high altar, below which lie the relics of St James, in a Roman mausoleum. The crossing lantern houses the suspension mechanism for the botafumeiro. This is a huge baroque censer whose pendulum swings down the entire length of the transepts during special ceremonies, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle.</p>]]></Body>

In what seems to be a theme with Barcelona's religious buildings, it was not completed until the 20th century when the spire and facade were added. Highlights include the carved choir stalls, the Capella de Lepanto (Lepanto Chapel) and the tranquil cloisters containing a pond of 13 white geese.

Highlights within the main palace include the late-rococo Steinerner Saal (Hall of Stone) and the Gallery of Beauties - a collection of portraits of beautiful women commissioned by Ludwig I. The extensive grounds conceal four miniature palaces, one of which, the Amalienburg, is considered the most attractive rococo palace in Germany. The Nymphenburg complex also includes the Marstallmuseum, which houses royal coaches and riding equipment, as well as an historic collection of Nymphenburg porcelain, with exhibits from 1747 until the 1920s.</p>]]></Body>

There are no regular guided tours, although a free audio guide is available in five languages, including English. Other royal treasures are on show in the Schatzkammer (Treasury).

For centuries it was known as the Schrannenmarkt (the place where merchants came to buy and sell goods) but was renamed after the Virgin Mary in 1854. The square&rsquo;s north side is entirely dominated by the neo-gothic Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall), built in the 19th century. Miniature statues of Bavarian rulers adorn the hall's fa&ccedil;ade, while the 85m (279ft) tower houses a 43 bell glockenspiel with mechanical marionettes. Visitors can ascend the tower by lift. Nearby, other buildings of note include the 15th-century Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall) and, just a stone's throw from the square, Frauenkirche cathedral, where an intriguing mark known as the &lsquo;Devil's Footprint' remains embedded in the church floor.</p>]]></Body>

It&rsquo;s best to visit the area on a sightseeing cruise before returning for the nightlife. The area is packed with restaurants, bars, and shops.</p>]]></Body>

Through the main doors, visitors are rewarded with a peerless collection of post&ndash;war art, predominantly by German and American artists. There&rsquo;s work from modern masters including Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon and Joseph Beuys. In addition to its vast permanent collection, the museum also plays host to a series of impressive rolling exhibitions and has an excellent cafe-restaurant for hungry visitors too. The museum has two additional exhibition sites, the MMK 2 (TaunusTurm, Taunustor 1) and the MMK 3 (Domstr. 3).&nbsp;</p>]]></Body>

It&rsquo;s surrounded by half-timbered houses, reconstructed after they were destroyed in 1945, and the former court chapel - the Nikolaikirche (Church of St Nicholas). The main attraction, however, is the Rathaus R&ouml;mer (Frankfurt's city hall since 1405) with its Gothic stepped gables made of red sandstone. The coronation of German emperors was celebrated in the Kaisersaal (Emperor's Hall) on the upper floors and portraits of 52 emperors hang on the walls. It is still a working town hall, however, so unfortunately there are no dedicated tours. <br />
<br />
R&ouml;merberg is also home to one of Germany&rsquo;s best Christmas markets, which has taken place each December since the 14th century.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Between 1562 and 1792, German emperors were crowned in the Cathedral of St Bartholomew, hence its other name - the Kaiserdom (Emperor Cathedral). In the 1950s, this was Frankfurt's tallest building at 96m (315ft), which illustrates just how much the city has developed since then. The cathedral has a red sandstone facade and interior and is one of Frankfurt's most recognisable landmarks. The present structure was rebuilt after WWII but contains a number of original carvings. There are also great views of the city from the tower. A museum, the Dom-Museum, is attached to the cathedral and is packed full of ancient archaeological findings.</p>]]></Body>

Of the 1,441 rooms in the palace and its adjacent buildings, 40 state rooms are open to the public. The golden-yellow palace is set within equally magnificent gardens, landscaped in the baroque style, with some fabulous views. The palace and gardens are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. The Gloriette is a triumphal arch that stands on the hilltop behind the palace and affords a stunning view over the grounds and the city beyond. The Palmenhaus (Palm House) is an excellent example of late 19th-century architecture, with cast iron columns delicately holding up the glass walls and roof. The world's oldest zoo (from 1752) can be found in the park too.</p>]]></Body>

It has put Porto on the 21st-century map, both in terms of its architecture and its programme, hosting a stunning array of concerts and performances. It opened in 2005, four years late and cost €109 million, exceeding the initial budget by more than €80 million. The architecture is so modern and daring that it has proved highly controversial in Porto. Still, there is no disputing the originality of the vision behind the Casa da Musica, the city's new iconic music house. Few can complain about its acoustics, as the main concert hall is considered one of the best in the world.</p>]]></Body>

A true Porto landmark, it has a beautiful Belle Epoque decor, and it still offers the kind of refined atmosphere and service that made it the city's favourite more than 80 years ago.</p>]]></Body>

The museum was built around the remains of the archaeological site, partly underground, with subterranean passages connecting the various exhibits. Its collection comes primarily from discoveries made in Lyon and throughout the Rhône-Alpes region. Of special interest are the extraordinary series of inscriptions, statues, mosaics, sarcophagi and everyday objects from Gallo-Roman life. One of the museum's most prized possessions is the Claudius Tablet, which contains fragments of a speech made by Emperor Claudius in front of the Roman Senate.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Lyon City Hall's original structure, built in 1646, was Louis XIII in style, however, later embellishments made the outside more elaborate and Italianate, with sculptured pediments and domes gracing the pavilions. The interior, with its extravagant baroque-style décor, is the result of 19th-century renovation. Highlights include Thomas Blachet's 17th-century allegorical frescoes and the most impressive room, the Grand Salon. However, the great staircase is the unmistakable centrepiece and visitors should look up at the vaulted ceiling celebrating <em>'L'éternité de la gloire de Lyon</em>' (<em>'The eternal glory of Lyon</em>'). The bell tower is also remarkable, with three of the original 1675 bells and a 20th-century carillon. The tourist office can organise tours of Hôtel de Ville, but they are in French.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This well-designed museum puts Lyon's role during WWII into context. Ironically, it's located in the former headquarters of the Gestapo, where the local leader, Klaus Barbie (known as the 'Butcher of Lyon'), tortured or killed his victims and sent thousands of others to concentration camps. The curators of the permanent exhibition have made a conscious effort to illustrate the somewhat ambiguous position of France during its occupation while also portraying the importance of Lyon as a centre of organised French resistance.</p>]]></Body>

Designed to look like a building turned inside out, tubes, pipes, stairs and fittings race around the outside of the building in an unapologetic display of primary colours. The art on the inside makes the exterior look tame. The centre was extended to cope with the huge numbers of people visiting its expanding collection of contemporary art and multimedia library.</p>]]></Body>

Works of Rodin's mistress and pupil, Camille Claudel, and paintings by Van Gogh, Monet and Renoir are also on display. Outside, is the godly physique of <em>The Thinker</em>, which contrasts sharply with the decrepitude of the writhing figures of <em>The Gates of Hell</em>.</p>]]></Body>

Cobblestoned streets and old Flemish town houses (now home to exclusive boutiques) make for a pleasant stroll in a part of Lille barely changed in centuries. Meander along the winding backstreets and soak up the atmosphere and history of the city. Vieux Lille is particularly lively on Sundays, when the market takes place, but it's just as rewarding to take a seat at a café and watch life go by. If you're feeling more culturally inclined, the modern façade and gothic interiors of the nearby cathedral are fascinating to explore.</p>]]></Body>

As the focal point of a religious order set up to care for the sick, the building and its contents are a key element of the visit. The rooms here show how nuns would have carried out their day-to-day tasks, with information given for each area. It is also home to a collection of gold, silver and earthenware objects, tapestries of Guillaume Werniers, paintings by the Watteau brothers and several classic Flemish works.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Laid out in 1257, this is one of the largest and most beautiful market squares in medieval Europe. Occupying the centre of the square is the 15th-century Sukiennice (Cloth Hall), its vaulted, ground floor passages now filled with souvenir stalls. Along the sides of the building, pavement cafés draw locals and tourists alike. A gallery of 19th Century Polish art is upstairs, full of lavish, melodramatic paintings that are actually quite fun. The square is lined by grand old houses, and filled with the church of St Wojciech (Cracow's oldest) and the lone 15th century town hall tower. It's the towering twin spires of the Gothic Mariacki church, looming in one corner, that really dominate the square and catch the eye.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Kościół Mariacki is arguably Cracow's most important church. The most striking detail within this eye-catching, Gothic structure is Wit Stwosz's stunning wooden altarpiece, the largest in Europe.  Dating from 1489, the Gothic altarpieces is opened at midday each day to reveal the intricate, beautifully carved scenes within, centred around the Dormition of the Virgin. Above the organ loft, the church also boasts excellent 14th-century stained glass as well as art nouveau glass by Stanislaw Wyspianski and Jozef Mehoffer. Outside, the taller of the two towers was once the city's watchtower and, every hour, a trumpeter plays the traditional <em>Hejnał Mariacki </em>(St. Mary's Trumpet Call) from one of the top windows, always cutting short the last note. This tradition is said to be to commemorate a trumpeter killed by a Turkish arrow while Krakow was under siege.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Part of the Wawel castle complex, this cathedral was the coronation site and burial place of almost all of Poland's monarchs and rulers. It was built in the early 11th century by King Boleslaw the Brave after Cracow was made a bishopric, and substantially added to since. The relics of St Stanislaw, the patron saint of Poland, are kept here, as are the bodies of many kings, queens and national poets in many elaborate chapels built into the walls. Controversially, Poland's late president, Lech Kaczynski, who died in a plane crash in 2010, was laid to rest here in what had traditionally been a royal burial site. After admiring the architecture, visitors can climb the tower to see the 9,979kg (11-tonne) Sigismund Bell and enjoy fine views.</p>]]></Body>

Highlights include Jan Matejko's monumental <em>Battle of Grunwald</em> (1878), which celebrates the Polish victory over the Teutonic Knights in 1410, and the Faras Collection of early Christian and Egyptian art, which is unique in Europe. The collection of medieval art is also remarkable &ndash; if somewhat gruesome in parts. Unusually, there are also galleries of Polish and European decorative arts.

Destroyed during WWII, the cathedral has been reconstructed in its original style and features major gothic art works by Wit Stwosz.

Pre-war Warsaw had a Jewish population second only to New   York. After the Nazi invasion, some 450,000 Jews were rounded up and forced into the city's so-called ghetto. A 3m (10ft) wall encircled the area, from the Palace  of Culture and Science to the Umschlagplatz monument, at the corner of Ulica Stawki and Ulica Dzika. This stark monument marks the place from where Jews were despatched by train to the Treblinka concentration camp, following the Ghetto Uprising of 19 April 1943. Only three sections of the actual wall remain.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Varsovians are divided over this prime example of Socialist Realism. For decades it has been, at 231m (758ft), the tallest building in Poland and a reminder of Stalin's bravura - it was a gift from him to the city, built between 1952 and 1955. Detractors still reckon that the best views of the city are from the top of the structure since it is the only place in Warsaw where you cannot see the Palace of Culture and Science. The viewing platform on the 30th floor at 115m (377ft) does indeed give a terrific view over Warsaw. Besides offices, the building houses a concert hall, a multiscreen cinema, three theatres and two museums.</p>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Castell Coch is a flamboyant gothic fantasy that was created as a rural retreat for the Marquis of Bute. It was commissioned to complement the opulence of Cardiff Castle, the Marquis&rsquo;s main residence. The architect William Burges was given free rein and didn&rsquo;t hold back. The result is a fairytale castle, with round towers, dazzling walls and ceilings, and red turrets. It stands as an example of an unbounded Victorian imagination combined with pots of cash. Castell Coch is situated in woodlands at Tongwynlais, just outside Cardiff. It is easily accessible by train or car.</p>]]></Body>

It was in this church that Roald Dahl was christened, so it is no surprise that he was president of the organisation that raised funds to restore it after it fell into disrepair. The church was dismantled and moved from its original site as part of the redevelopment of the docks and today it hosts an art gallery and café.</p>]]></Body>

The city's first church was thought to have been built on the same site in the 7th century, while the heart of the ancient Roman fortress also lies beneath the Minster, remnants of which be glimpsed by delving into the bowels of the cathedral. The classic Gothic style was cutting-edge at the time of construction (between 1220 and 1472), and the masons weren't sure of the load-bearing capacity of the pillars, so they built the impressive vaults in wood (an early example of no-nonsense Yorkshire practicality). Today's restoration efforts use limestone from the same quarry as the original.</p>]]></Body>

However, York – or Jorvik – was an important trading hub in the Viking world, which in part contributed to it becoming England's second city. Constructed by the York Archaeological Trust on the site of the famous Viking dig, the museum displays numerous artefacts including tools, jewellery and fine-crafted combs. There are also impressive interactive multimedia installations, and a glass floor at the entrance that allows visitors to look down at the Viking town lying beneath. The centrepiece is the sophisticated ride in rollercoaster-style capsules, which flies you through a recreation of Jorvik, complete with authentic huts and inhabitants brought to life by animatronics.</p>]]></Body>

												<Body><![CDATA[<p>Stone walls coil around York for 3.5km (2 miles) and are the longest medieval town walls in England that are still intact. The stretch from Monkbar to Petergate is particularly picturesque and walking the whole length will take about two hours. There are interpretive panels at 16 key points along the route, five historic gateways and 45 towers. The highest and most impressively crafted of the gateways is called Monk Bar and dates back to the 14th century. A self-contained fortress with an arch, it also contains the new Richard III Experience, dedicated to the House of York's infamous last king. Meanwhile, Micklegate Bar continues the story with the Henry VII Experience.</p>]]></Body>

After a period as a public ballroom, it was faithfully restored in 1984 as a museum house, and now provides a fascinating window onto York's Georgian past. As the property of a prestigious York family (peculiar for having held fast to Catholicism after the Reformation) Fairfax House shows the splendour of York's high society during 18th century. A friendly team of experts can be found on each room offering a wealth of information about the family, as well as local York history from the perspective of the upper classes.</p>]]></Body>

A leisure centre for soldiers who watched the fortress that once loomed over the rivers of Ouse and Foss, it includes the Tepidarium (warm room), Caldarium (steam room) and Frigidarium (for cooling off). Get to grips with a Roman soldier's life by seeing where they would have bathed, socialised and defecated, and don't miss the chance to try on armour, helmets and shields. As the base of the ninth legion, who waged campaigns against the Brigantes and Caledonians, the York fortress even hosted Emperor Septimius Serverus for three years until his death in 211 AD.</p>]]></Body>

The elegant, neoclassical 18th-century building itself is worth a look, a calming retreat from Glasgow's busy shopping scene. It's also worth visiting the galleries at Trongate 103, a short walk from GOMA.</p>]]></Body>

				<Body><![CDATA[<p>Situated close to the town of Westport in County Mayo, the peak of Croach Patrick, rising 765m (2,510ft), was a sacred pagan site of spiritual significance for hundreds of years before the arrival of Christianity. Saint Patrick travelled across Ireland spreading the word of God and, according to religious stories, arrived at what is now known as Croach Patrick in AD441 where he spent forty days and forty nights fasting on the summit of the mountain. By the seventh century, Croach Patrick had become one of the most important Christian pilgrimage sites in Ireland. And still today, each summer millions of pilgrims, many walking barefoot as a penance for wrongdoings, ascend Croach Patrick to visit the small church at the summit. The last Sunday in July is the main pilgrimage day attracting thousands of pilgrims, but the climb remains popular throughout the year, with walkers ascending the mountain for the spectacular views across Clew Bay.</p>]]></Body>

From here Guayasamín cultivated an eclectic range of friends from Fidel Castro to the Rockefellers, while creating an almost unparalleled collection of vibrant modern art. Apart from his paintings, there are Incan artefacts and colonial works from his private collection on display.</p>]]></Body>

Although visible from almost everywhere around the city, when viewed up close the aluminium colossus is rather bizarre, not least for the set of wings – rarely seen in depictions of the Virgin. Built in 1976, the statue is inspired by a similar 18th-century sculpture by Ecuadorian artist Bernardo de Legarda, which can be found in the Church of San Francisco. Naturally, at more than 3,000 metres high, El Panecillo is one of the best vantage points in Quito too. It's best to take a taxi to the top: apart from being tiring, the climb is said to be fraught with robbers.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Tickets to the Guayasamín Museum also provide access to the magnificent Capilla del Hombre, an ambitious 'chapel of humanity'. Built as a stone monolith with vague connotations of a pre-Hispanic temple, everything here was designed and created by Ecuador's most famous artist, both inside and out. The grand interior is adorned with murals and smaller paintings, as well as sculptures and installations, which all tell the story of civilization. The tale is tinged by Guayasamín's passion for social justice and the central mural, showing spirits ascending to the heavens, was unfinished upon his death. Be sure to take one of the free guided tours (in English and Spanish), which illuminate the fascinating life and ideology of the artist.</p>]]></Body>

Sculptures from the 18th-century, like The Holy Shroud by Manuel Chili Caspicara, are amongst the artistic highlights.

Visitors will also find the quirky Intiñan Solar Museum, which is dedicated to ancient beliefs and astronomical knowledge of indigenous people and lies on the actual equator. Most tourists here try to balance an egg test on a nail as gravitational pulls are different on the equator. There is also a chance to prove (or disprove) the fable that water drains clockwise and anticlockwise on either side of the equator.</p>]]></Body>

There is a church on the top, which was erected when the original chapel was destroyed in the 1917 earthquake. It gets very busy on Sundays when pilgrims and tourists flood the place. Apart from the church itself, the surrounding area is commercialised with food and souvenir stalls, but the view from the peak is magnificent. On a clear day one can spot Los Nevados, the volcano range in the Cordillera Central, 135km (84 miles) away to the west.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The imposing cathedral on Plaza de Bolivar's eastern end is the biggest in Colombia and one of the biggest in South America. A neoclassical masterpiece that would match almost any in Spain, it looms over the rest of the square like an old lord surveying his subjects. La Catedral Primada was erected in 1823 on the site of the city's first humble church, when Bogotá was made up of a few simple houses. The city's inaugural mass is also said to have taken place on the site in 1538. The inside is eerily solemn and surprisingly bare. Paul Theroux generalised Bogotá's church interiors as "elegant…with a touch of voodoo", and in the case of its cathedral, he was onto something. Apart from some paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries, it houses one of the largest organs in Latin America and the tomb of the city's founder, Jiménez de Quesada.</p>]]></Body>

Also known as Casa de Nariño, the palace was originally the house of Antonio Nariño, one of the fathers of independence. Rebuilt and extended in 1908, it is as grand and impressive as you'd expect for the home of the President of Colombia. It's also heavily guarded. However, the palace does open its gates each afternoon for the changing of the guard and it's worth seeing this extravagant march, which is full of pomp. The palace gardens also feature the oldest observatory in the new world. Visits to the palace must be arranged through the website.</p>]]></Body>

Despite some unfortunate architectural influences from 20th century, the barrio remains largely soaked in the colonial spirit and lifestyle. Some buildings are being restored to their former glory, others remain dilapidated. The first buildings were built in the 16th century and today's La Candelaria is actually a group of old districts such as La Catedral, Egypto and La Concordial. The area was declared a National Monument in 1964. The streets of the old Santa Fe are full of old Spanish-style mansions with heavy doors, large halls, spacious rooms, patios, thick walls and various styles of balconies. The 19th- and 20th-century buildings are locally known as Republican. La Candelaria of today has a strong bohemian, cultural and academic flavour.</p>]]></Body>

This verdant precipice is more isolated and tranquil than its neighbour, but more difficult to reach. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe church first stood atop the hill in 1656, but was reduced to ruins four times by earthquakes. The church was last rebuilt in 1967 and features a striking wood-carving of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Her appearance to the Mexican peasant in 16th century is one of the defining moments in the conversion of indigenous people to Catholicism, and she is revered throughout Latin America. One of Bogotá's main icons stands outside the church, the 15m (49 ft) sculpture of the Virgin by local artist, Gustavo Arcila Uribe.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>One of the last remnants of Atlantic Rainforest, Tijuca National Park is the world's largest urban forest and Brazil's only inner city national park, giving Rio residents and visitors a huge natural wonderland on its doorstep. The park embraces the city, its dense vegetation tumbling down steep mountainsides from Corcovado west to Barra de Tijuca. Much of the forest was cleared for coffee plantations in the 19th century but a reforestation project successfully restored it, bringing back many rare animals and plants to their original habitat.</p><p>The park's abundant flora includes eucalyptus, jacaranda and jackfruit trees, orchids and bromeliads, as well as many species of birds, ocelots, monkeys, butterflies and reptiles. There are waterfalls and cooling streams too, as well as viewpoints such as Mirante Dona Marta and Vista Chinesa, which provide some of the city's most awesome panoramas. Hundreds of walking and cycling trails lead through the forest, including ascents of Rio's highest peaks, Pico da Tijuca at 1021m (3350 ft) and Bico do Papagaio at 990m (3250 ft). Some isolated stretches can be targeted by criminals, so visitors are advised not to go alone but join one of the guided walks offered by trekking companies.</p><p>If all this sounds too strenuous, there are various picnic spots for relaxation and enjoyment of the natural surroundings.</p>]]></Body>

The world's biggest stadium was originally capable of holding around 200,000 people when it was built to host the 1950 World Cup Final. Even since converting to all-seated terracing in 1999, it still has capacity for 100,000 spectators. As well as football matches, live concerts have also been held at the Maracan&atilde;. Over the years many mega stars have performed here including Frank Sinatra, Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones and Madonna. The stadium went through an extensive programme of refurbishment in preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals and again before the 2016 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>In its heyday, the stadium was used up to three times a week, hosting home fixtures for three of Rio&rsquo;s biggest football clubs: Flamengo, Fluminese and Vasco. But, since the Olympics, costs to stage matches have spiralled, pricing all three clubs out of using the stadium. Redevelopment work has stalled and, as of January 2017, Maracan&atilde; Stadium remains in a dilapidated state - 7,000 of its 80,000 seats missing.</p>]]></Body>

The area became famous in the mid 1960s with the worldwide smash hit, 'The Girl from Ipanema'. The bar where the songwriters sat to "watch the girl passing by", now known as Garota de Ipanema, is a firm favourite among tourists.</p><p>The daytime focus of Ipanema is the beach, incorporating Arpoador and Leblon beaches at either end. Like Copacabana, Ipanema draws beach-lovers who exercise, sun bathe, or just people watch. Each evening, locals crowd onto the sand to watch the sun setting behind the imposing peak of Dois Irmãos. Shopping is also a major pastime as many of Rio's best fashion outlets and jewellery stores are here, particularly along Avenida Garcia d'Avila and Rua Visconde de Pirajá. Souvenir hunters flock to the Feira Hippie crafts market on Sundays. By night, Ipanema's rich and beautiful set comes out to play, mingling in its cocktail bars, gourmet restaurants and nightclubs.</p>]]></Body>

Other highlights include a pond of giant Vitoria Regis waterlilies, as well as thousands of orchids, bromeliads, insectivorous plants and a sensory garden created with wheelchair users in mind.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>One of Rio's oldest neighbourhoods, leafy hillside Santa Teresa is lined with gently crumbling colonial mansions and its cobblestone streets offer stunning views over the city centre below. The favoured home for Rio's artists and writers, Santa Teresa is a quiet and attractive district that is also popular with visitors wishing to escape the crowded Zona Sul. It has a good range of upscale boutique hotels, arty bed and breakfasts and backpacker hostels, as well as gourmet restaurants, cafes and bars. The Museu da Chácara do Céu is the area's top art museum, but there are a couple of other museums worth checking out too, along with art galleries and handicraft shops. Getting to Santa Teresa is another of its highlights, via Rio's only surviving tramline. The historic open-sided wooden <em>bondes</em> lurch up the winding streets, making this an unmissable experience. The line is due to re-open in time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup after a modernisation programme.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Rio's most famous neighbourhood, Copacabana, is best known for its amazing beach that stretches in a wide sandy arc for 4km (2.5 miles). Carioca girls, in dental floss bikinis, bask in the scorching sun alongside young families, senior citizens and newly arrived tourists. The seafront is a hive of activity from dawn until dusk. Early morning joggers and power walkers pound the wavy, black and white mosaic path that fringes the beach, cyclists whizz by in the cycle lane, and the beach football pitches and volleyball courts are in constant use. As on most of Rio's beaches, strong currents make swimming hazardous, although vigilant lifeguards keep a careful watch from the numbered <em>postos</em> (lookout stations).</p><p>Nearby, top-class resort hotels and apartment blocks dominate the seafront Avenida Atlântica. It is advisable to take the minimum of possessions and money to the beach, as the obvious tourist is an easy target for petty thieves.</p>]]></Body>

The second leg completes the journey to the Sugarloaf over a distance of 750m (2,460 ft).</p><p>The final stop offers fine views of the beaches, the city, the mountains of Tijuca National Park and the islands of Guanabara Bay. Just before sunset is the most dramatic time to arrive, to see the city lights and the Christ Redeemer statue illuminated on the horizon.

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>So named because of its distinctive steeply hunched peak, Corcovado rises over Tijuca National Park. It is home to what is probably the most recognizable image of Rio: that of the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue, which seems to dominate the skyline from every side of the city. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, and inaugurated in 1931, the iconic open-armed statue stands on top of the 710m (2,330 ft) mountain and is itself 30m (99 ft) tall. The site is best visited via the historic cog railway, which takes 20 minutes to wind up through the forest to a station just below the summit. From here, 220 steep steps lead to the summit; alternatively take one of the lifts or escalators. Weather permitting (early morning mist is common); there are stunning views of the whole city and bay area below. After dark, floodlights illuminate the statue, providing a dramatic sight visible all across Rio.</p>]]></Body>

At the weekend, visitors join the city's residents for a stroll, jog or cycle on the 8km (5 miles) perimeter path, with bicycles and four-wheeled pedal buggies available for hire. Children paddle around the lake on swan-shaped pedalos, while others enjoy its waterfront cafes, exercise stations and stalls serving coconut milk fresh from the shell. In the evening, the lakeside takes on a romantic mood, as diners sit under the stars at one of the many <em>quiosques</em> (open-air restaurants), which specialise in regional and international cuisine.

The flying saucer-like building is still as futuristic as when it was completed in 1996. The gallery is suspended over a pond by a single pillar, while visitors enter via a sweeping curved ramp. The overall effect is light, airy, and breathtaking; the art on show inside isn't bad either. MAC's permanent collection comprises some 1,200 paintings and sculptures by major Brazilian artists and other Latin American creatives. The huge wraparound windows will distract even the most avid art lover as they afford stunning views over the water of Sugarloaf and Rio's mountainous skyline. The best way to visit the museum is via ferry from downtown Praca XV to Charitas port, which was also designed by Niemeyer.</p>]]></Body>

Today, Lapa is fully established as Rio's hotspot for live music. Many artists and writers have lived here over the years, and its sprawling old warehouses have been converted into wonderfully atmospheric clubs, bars, galleries and restaurants. By day, the cobbled backstreets are quiet and some corners are not safe for wandering around alone, but at night visitors can hop from club to club, sampling everything from reggae and rock to samba and bossa nova, even chamber music at the historic Sala Cecília Meireles. Architectural highlights include the iconic Arcos de Lapa, a whitewashed arched viaduct, which also houses a couple of Lapa's biggest music venues: Circo Voador and Fundição Progresso. On the first Saturday of the month is the Feira do Rio Antigo, a sprawling antiques market along Rua Lavradio, where dusty stores overflow with bric-a-brac, clothes and collectible knickknacks.</p>]]></Body>

The rather poetic descriptions of items on display – which include silver, woodwork and ceramics – attempt to rank the pieces alongside fine art. The objects, however, speak for themselves. Displays are divided amongst the various indigenous cultures dating from the 13th century and delight in their imagination, intricacy and variety. The Mochica culture is the most advanced with skilfully sculpted pottery and ornaments adorned with animals including the ubiquitous llama.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Taking visitors from the earliest cultures in Peru through to the reign of the Incas in the 13th century and beyond, this informative museum gives a wholesome understanding of one of the world's greatest empires. Telling the story through artefacts that range from ceramics and jewellery to weapons and hairbrushes, it's possible to grasp just how complex and sophisticated the Incas were. The room about textiles – more prized by the Incas than gold – is perhaps the most impressive; the explanations on what different patterns depict and represent are truly illuminating. Upstairs you'll come face to face with real mummies, their hands grasping around agape mouths as if in horror.</p>]]></Body>

Unlike much of the ancient Incan city of Qosqo, the walls here weren't completely decimated by the conquistadores. The interlocking stones (some measuring more than 3m (10ft) in height) make for mightily imposing walls and demonstrate the Incan talent for engineering. After a decisive battle with Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1536, many of the stones were carried down to Cusco below for building work.</p><p>Ascend a little way up the hill and you'll come to the site's 20th century addition, Cristo Blanco, a huge statue of Christ with outstretched arms à la Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer. While the statue's facial expression is bewilderingly cartoonish, its lofty vantage point provides a fantastic view of the city.</p><p>Wander further still to find the mysterious Temple of the Moon. This strange rock formation, resembling a meteorite, was very important to the Incas. With faces, altars and steps cut into the stone, as well as cave entrances and spooky passages, there's an ominous feel of how significant this ceremonial site once was.</p><p>Other than these, there's the outlying ruin of Tambo Machay, which translate as 'the Inca's Baths', and the carved limestone monolith of Salapunco.</p>]]></Body>

There are hundreds of dazzling gold and silver artefacts from pre-Conquest to colonial times, including a yellow-feathered Inca poncho and a skull sporting teeth made of pink quartz. Notoriously, in the early 2000s, many of the museum's artefacts were exposed as fakes. The museum now assures that all displays are authentic unless stated as reproductions. </p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Once the official mint, la Moneda became the presidential residence in 1846. While Chile's head of state no longer lives on site, the building's presidential offices are still used. The bombing of Moneda Palace by air force jets during General Augusto Pinochet's coup against Salvador Allende's Marxist government in 1973 remains an enduring image of the 20th century. Allende took his own life in this building with a gun given to him, according to local legend, by Fidel Castro. Visitors can stroll along the courtyard that runs through the middle of the building, and can arrange to visit the interior with an advance booking. On the south side of the Moneda Palace, on (or rather under) Plaza de la Ciudadanía, is the modern Centro Cultural Palacio de la Moneda, which has a series of exhibition spaces and some first-rate exhibitions. There is also an excellent shop selling traditional Chilean handicrafts.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Villa Grimaldi, the former headquarters of General Pinochet's notorious secret police force, reopened in 1997 under a new guise as a memorial park to the victims of Chile's military dictatorship. An estimated 5,000 political prisoners were detained and tortured here between the 1973 military coup and 1987 – and 226 of these 'disappeared'. The park opened in March 1997, marking a crucial step in Chile's reconciliation with its bloody past, and was the first government-sanctioned memorial to Pinochet's victims. It houses an oral archive, a museum that provides context for place and to promote human rights. There's also a wide programme of guided and self-guided tours.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Since colonial times, Santiago's focus has been its spacious main square, the Plaza de Armas. Surrounded by grand colonial public buildings, most notably the Metropolitan Cathedral and the ornate Correos Central (central post office), it acts as a haven from Santiago's often oppressive traffic. A central corral of Chilean palm trees shades courting couples, vendors and tourists. Local artists display their latest canvasses and on weekday evenings the square is the scene of a thriving Santiago institution when locals set up trestle tables and pit their wits against each other in fiercely contested chess matches.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>This museum, which has changed locations several times in recent years, houses works of art donated by artists from around the world. The collection began in 1971 when a group of artists and thinkers decided to bring together contemporary works of art to show their sympathy with the socialist policies of the Salvador Allende government. During Pinochet's military dictatorship, exiled artists continued the project and the collection now includes donations by artists from over 39 countries such as Joan Miró, Roberto Matta, Antonio Saura and Yoko Ono. From the 500 works gathered by 1973, there are now more than 2,650. There's also a brilliant programme of temporary exhibitions across all media.</p>]]></Body>

<p>On occasion, visitors can catch traditional Thai dancers and even an orchestra, both of whom are often hired by worshippers who want their prayers answered. For an aerial view of the shrine, head to the elevated walkway of the BTS Skytrain above.</p>]]></Body>

It was re-landscaped to host Thailand&rsquo;s first Expo in 1920s, which failed to happen as the king passed away. The park later opened for public use in 1952.</p>
<p>During the cooler months from December to February, the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra host a series of free concerts in the park on Sundays featuring guest singers. Other activities include boating on the lake, al fresco t&rsquo;ai chi and jogging.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Just 55km (34 miles) north of Seoul is one of the world&rsquo;s most curious attractions, the Korean Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). What is actually a decades-old ceasefire area, the DMZ is a buffer region between South and North Korea that has been in place since the Korean War armistice of 1953.</p>
<p>The tourist-friendly section of the DMZ includes sites like the 3rd Tunnel, an underground infiltration route, and Panmunjeom, where peace talks between North and South Korea are still held. There are also shrines, an observatory, mountains and Imjingak, a park displaying artwork alongside relics and monuments from the Korean conflict. Since the conflict ceased, internationally protected species, endangered species and protected wild flora and fauna have also flourished here. You must join an organised tour to visit the DMZ. The International Culture Service Club (tel: +82 2 755 0073; <a href="http://www.tourdmz.com" target="_blank">www.tourdmz.com</a>) and KTB Tour (tel: +82 2 778 0150; <a href="http://www.go2korea.co.kr" target="_blank">www.go2korea.co.kr</a>) both offer regular excursions in English.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Across from the Notre Dame Cathedral, the vast Post Office was built in the late 19th century in a European style. Designed by Gustave Eiffel, it is often likened to a railway station in appearance, but the elegant, high-ceilinged interior has hardly been touched since it was erected and is dominated by a huge portrait of Ho Chi Minh. Even its original phone booths still remain in place. Also of interest are two maps on the walls dating from 1892, one depicting Saigon and the surrounding areas. The building always seems busy but most people are visitors rather than customers. Fascinating collections of colourful stamps can be purchased here too.</p>]]></Body>

In a small garden in front of the cathedral lies a delicate statue of the Virgin Mary. Unlike most French cathedrals, the interior of the cathedral is rather plain, with no stained glass, but it offers a cool respite from the heat outside. It is also an oasis of calm from the incessant traffic that circles the cathedral. There is still a significant Christian community in the south of Vietnam and church services are well attended.</p>]]></Body>

Rooms open to the public remain exactly as they were in 1975, showing where important meetings were held during the war, as well as some of the private quarters of the president and his family.

Built in a classical style in the late 1880s, the museum building itself is of interest as it was formerly the palace of the governor of Cochinchina and the Supreme Court.</p>]]></Body>

The museum was originally an archaeological research institution by the &Eacute;cole Fran&ccedil;aise d'Extr&ecirc;me Orient of 1910.

Inspired by the shape of a lotus bud (the Vietnamese national flower), the glass and steel building symbolises the new Vietnam. The observation deck on the 49th floor offers stunning views of the city and Saigon River.

The pagoda is surrounded by a tranquil walled garden and there is a seven-storey stupa storing relics of the Buddha. Families of the old and sick regularly go to the pagoda to pin supplications to the large bronze bell, in the belief that when it is rung, the messages will be sent to the heavens above. Time your visit right and you may find yourself witnessing the monks chanting. Remember to always dress respectfully with shoulders covered.</p>]]></Body>

Groundlings can still visit, ascending by the vertiginous Peak Tram - a funicular in use since 1888, which feels more like a Victorian-era Space Shuttle, or by taxi or bus. Atop the hill is the Sky Terrace 428 viewing platform, Madam Tussauds waxwork museum, several restaurants, and the revamped Peak Galleria shopping arcade. Hikers can scale the real peak, some 140m (459ft) above the tram terminus, or leisurely follow the Peak Circuit route with vistas over Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the outlying islands. Both are signposted.</p>]]></Body>

The building is spectacularly colourful with its red pillars, golden ceiling and decorated latticework, although not particularly distinguished. Far more fascinating are the fortune-tellers in their arcade of booths and the throngs of worshippers.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Known locally as Lingyin Si (Temple of the Soul's Retreat), this is one of China's largest Buddhist temples. The entrance is magnificent, passing through shallow caves and grottos featuring over 400 Buddhist rock carvings, many dating from the 10th to 14th centuries. The incense-filled, working temple boasts four grand halls, each more lavish and colourful than the last. The stand-out is the 12m-high (39ft) Hall of the 500 Arhats, which features 500 human-sized sitting Buddhist saints, each holding his own symbol, arranged in the formation of a giant swastika. Located next to Lingyin Temple, is a cable car which wheels its way up North Peak and offers fabulous views across parts of West Lake and the surrounding tea plantations.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Centuries of careful cultivation have turned what was originally a lagoon adjoining the Qiantang River into the most famous lake in China. One of the country's principal tourist attractions, West Lake is classical China at its mist-shrouded, willow-lined, pagoda-dotted best, and is almost everybody's primary reason for visiting Hangzhou. Three ancient, man-made causeways (Su, Bai and Yanggong) provide pleasant walkways across sections of the lake and are great places to begin your romantic strolls. Bai Causeway, accessed from the lake's northern shore, is perhaps the most interesting as it leads onto Gushan Island with its restaurants, museums and gardens. Cycling is a great way to navigate the area (there are bike rental kiosks everywhere), but boats can also be hired at dozens of places around the lake. West Lake was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011 for having &quot;influenced garden design in the rest of China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries&quot; and for reflecting &quot;an idealized fusion between humans and nature&quot;.</p>]]></Body>

So anxious were Delhi's new rulers to erect a mosque, they shamelessly pilfered 27 Hindu and Jain temples for building materials.

Giant white petals of marble open out from nine pools and walkways in the shape of an unfolding lotus, symbolising the nine spiritual paths of the Baha'i faith. Inside, the central hall rises to a height of over 30m (98ft). Photography is not permitted inside the temple and visitors are also requested to refrain from talking. Lines may be long, and while the inside is stunning, it may be better to drive by and snap a photo, using your time to see other sites rather than waiting to enter.</p>]]></Body>

Of the buildings still standing within this oldest known structure in Delhi, the Qila-i-Kuhna Masjid (Mosque of Sher Shah), is quite stunning. The Sher Mandal is an octagonal observatory and library. The north gate, Talaqi-Darwaza, has been partially rebuilt and gives a good impression of how formidable the fortifications would have been in their heyday.</p>]]></Body>

Originally a high school, thousands were tortured and killed here in the 1970s under Pol Pot&rsquo;s brutal regime. The school was surrounded by barbed wire and the classrooms were used to house manacled prisoners in crudely built cells. Other rooms contain a single bed frame and graphic photo of occupants left to die when the Khmer Rouge fled with the Vietnamese army approaching in January 1979. Most chilling are the photos of unidentified prisoners that cover the walls.</p>]]></Body>

However, the massive walls around it are from the original structure. With its tall walls (close to 30m/98ft) and wide moats, Osaka Castle is arguably one of Japan's most imposing castles. There are eight roof dolphins as well as ornamental roof tiles and tiger-shaped reliefs, which are all gilded with gold. The parkland by the castle is very pleasant, especially during the cherry blossom season in spring.</p>]]></Body>

The Chicken Market Bridge (an old drawbridge which dates back to the 17th century) is not too far away, though refrain from looking into its canal as you could still see why previous residents caught all sorts of mosquito-borne diseases. The canal empties out near Sunda Kelapa, Jakarta's old harbour, where Dutch vessels sit in their golden years.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Smack dab in the centre of Merdeka Square, the National Monument (Monas to locals) pierces Jakarta's concrete-filled skyline at 130m (426.5ft). The memorial, topped by a bronze flame coated in lavish gold, is the most important landmark in Jakarta, despite being an architectural excess constructed during a time of widespread poverty. For many it's considered a symbol of Indonesia's struggle against Dutch colonial rule; for others, a vile reminder of then dictator Soeharto's 32-year reign which gave totalitarianism a new meaning in history books. At its base is a museum displaying the history of Indonesia in 51 dioramas. An elevator takes visitors to an observation platform where you can see Jakarta growing vertically by the day.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Its slogan 'Indonesian Charm' befits one of Jakarta's most enjoyable haunts - The Beautiful Indonesia Miniature Park (<em>Taman Mini Indonesia Indah</em>). Opened in 1975 on a 100-hectare (247-acre) plot of land, the park was designed to be a microcosm of the entire archipelago, with each of Indonesia's original 27 provinces (plus an extra six since 1999) represented by its own pavilion bearing traditional architecture. Inside each pavilion are crafts, clothing and many other cultural tidbits. Water parks, museums and bird sanctuaries are also scattered across mini-Indonesia. Some pavilions offer traditional local cuisine and dance performances from selected provinces. Though it may not shed light on each of Indonesia's 700 languages spoken by 300 ethnic groups, it does serve as an adequate crash course on what to expect should you choose to use Jakarta as a jumping-off point for other Indonesian destinations.</p>]]></Body>

The park was created in 1975 and is centred around the <em>Morne Trois Pitons</em> (meaning 'mountain of three peaks'), a triple-spiked mountain formed from volcanic remains, which rises to 1342m (3681ft) above sea level. The <em>Valley of Desolation</em> is a barren area of volcanic rock which contains over 50 fumaroles (geysers) emitting sulphurous gases and steam. One of the most beautiful sites in the park is the <em>Emerald Pool</em>, a waterfall grotto located against a backdrop of tropical plants and flowers. <br /><strong>Air:</strong> Melville Hall Airport. <strong>Road:</strong> Bus: Regular public services. Car: Imperial Road to <em>Emerald Pool</em> (from Roseau); Trafalgar Road, then Laudat Road to <em>Trafalgar Falls </em>(from Roseau); Valley Road to <em>Freshwater Lake</em> or <em>Boiling Lake</em> (from Roseau).</p>]]></Body>

For hundreds of years before this, however, the site had been of religious and political significance, witnessing numerous battles between the English and the Vikings. Today, half of the surviving medieval stained glass in England is in the minster, with the <em>Great East Window </em>displaying over 100 Biblical scenes. The elaborate astronomical clock in the <em>North Transept</em> was designed and constructed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory to commemorate 18,000 airmen from Yorkshire and northeast England who lost their lives in World War II. A fire in the South Transept in 1984 led to a £2 million-pound restoration project, and the ceiling now features 62 new bosses decorated with natural and local scenes designed by schoolchildren. There are views of the winding cobbled streets of York and the surrounding Yorkshire countryside from the <em>Central Towe</em>r.<br /><strong>Air:</strong> Manchester Airport, Leeds/Bradford International Airport, Newcastle Airport. <strong>Rail:</strong> Train: York Station. <strong>Road:</strong> Bus: Public services.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>The Hejaz Railway Station, which is best visited in a taxi, is like a time-tunnel to a vanished age. Just ask the taxi driver to take you to Mahatta (Arabic for station). Trains leave from here to make the eight- or nine-hour trip to Damascus using rolling stock that was old when even Lawrence of Arabia was attempting to blow it up. There's a fine collection of working steam locomotives that are used for corporate and tourist excursions, a remarkable little railway museum and a very friendly station master too.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Squint a little, and perhaps bargain a bit, and Souk Al-Mubarakiya isn&rsquo;t as far from its humble beginnings as you&rsquo;d think. Now housed in a series of modern buildings, this city centre bazaar still squawks with the sound of hawkers and sings with the smell of spices, sweets and perfumes. Haggle for everything from Persian rugs to golden necklaces.</p>]]></Body>

										<Body><![CDATA[<p>Stretching from Marina Crescent to just past the Scientific Center, there&rsquo;s nowhere better for an evening stroll than Kuwait Corniche. Overlooking the turquoise bliss of Kuwait Bay, the promenade is dotted with pavilions, shaded walkways and caf&eacute;s, and is often filled with meandering families as the sun slowly disappears behind the horizon.</p>]]></Body>
