Tighten your website security and fight against dictionary bot attacks originating from other countries, by denying access.


== Description ==
This plugin hooks in the authenticate filter. By default, the plugin is set to allow all access and you can configure the plugin to allow the login only from some specified IPs or the specified countries. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONFIGURE THE PLUGIN TO ALLOW YOUR OWN ACCESS. If you set a restriction by IP, then you have to add your own IP (if you are using the plugin in a local setup the IP is 127.0.0.1 or ::1, this is added in your list by default). If you set a restriction by country, then you have to select from the list of countries at least your country. Both types of restrictions work independent, so you can set only one type of restriction or both if you want. Also, you can configure the redirects to frontpage when the URLs are accessed by someone that has a restriction. The restriction is either by country, or not in the specified IPs list.


== Installation ==
* Upload `Login IP & Country Restriction` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your application
* Login as Admin
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
